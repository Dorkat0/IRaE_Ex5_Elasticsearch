Winners receive a diploma and a medal, and each prize is also awarded 10 million Swedish krona, or about $900,000, which is divided if there are multiple winners.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the Nobels made adjustments. In 2020 and 2021, some events were canceled in favor of a digital ceremony for the winners, and the Oslo ceremony for the peace prize was smaller than in most years, with a limited audience. This year, laureates will receive their Nobel Prize medals and diplomas in Stockholm in December, the organization said, and winners from the previous two years will also be invited.\n\nThis year’s winners\nPhysiology or medicine\nImage\nSvante Pääbo with a model of a Neanderthal skeleton in Leipzig, Germany, on Monday.\nSvante Pääbo with a model of a Neanderthal skeleton in Leipzig, Germany, on Monday.Credit...Jens Schlueter/Getty Images\n\nOn Oct. 3, Svante Pääbo was awarded the year’s first prize, for physiology or medicine. Dr. Pääbo, a Swedish geneticist, won for his discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution.\n\nHe won for his work in retrieving genetic material from 40,000-year-old bones, producing a complete Neanderthal genome and initiating the field of ancient DNA studies.\n\nThanks for reading The Times.\nSubscribe to The Times\nRead more about his work here.\n\nPhysics\nImage\nFrom left: Alain Aspect, John F.

Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chair, and two other academics for their research into banks and financial crises.\n\nDouglas W. Diamond, an economist at the University of Chicago, and Philip H. Dybvig at Washington University in St. Louis won the prize alongside Mr. Bernanke, who is now at the Brookings Institution in Washington.\n\n(The economics award, among the highest honors in the field, is not, technically, a Nobel Prize. It is called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel because it wasn’t among the original categories that Alfred Nobel set out in his will in 1895.)\n\n",    "date":"10-10-2022",    "url":"https://www.nytimes.com/article/nobel-prizes-2022.html"}

Meet the Recipients So Far.",    "text":"The six prizes are awarded to individuals who made groundbreaking innovations in the fields of physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry, economic science, literature and peace work.\r\n\r\nBy Sam Silverman\r\nOctober 7, 2022 Updated: October 10, 2022\r\nThe Nobel Prize committees have announced the winners of this year's prestigious awards, and each recipient is a trailblazer in their respective field.\r\n\r\nThe winners are chosen by committees in Sweden and Norway that select six individuals who have excelled in physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry, economic science, literature and peace work. Traditionally, the committees announce one winner each day in Stockholm and Oslo during the first full week of October, and an in-person ceremony follows at a later date. However, this will be the first year since the start of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic that the winners will receive their medals and diplomas (not to mention 10 million Swedish kronor, or $900,000) in Stockholm in December. The winners from the past two years have been invited to join as well.\r\n\r\nThe Nobel Prize winners have been announced each October since the awards' inception in 1901. The awards are considered the most prestigious in the world and are given to \"those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind.\"\r\n\r\nKeep scrolling to meet the 2022 Nobel Prize laureates.\r\n\r\nPhysiology or medicine: Dr. Svante Pääbo\r\nDr. Svante Pääbo won the 2022 Nobel Prize for his discoveries in human evolution.\r\n\r\nThe Sweden-based geneticist produced a full Neanderthal genome by extracting genetic material from 40,000-year-old bones, marking a groundbreaking milestone in ancient DNA studies.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated: The Scientists Whose Research Led to Everything We Know About Sleep Just Won the Nobel Prize in Medicine\r\n\r\nPhysics: Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger\r\nAlain Aspect, John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger's work in quantum technology landed them the second Nobel Prize announced in 2022.\r\n\r\nAlthough Aspect is from France, Clauser hales from the U.S., and Zeilinger is from Austria, the three separately performed \"groundbreaking experiments\" using entangled quantum states that behaved as one unit even after being separated. \"Their results have cleared the way for new technology,\" the committee stated.\r\n\r\nChemistry: Carolyn R. Bertozzi, Morten Meldal and K. Barry Sharpless\r\nThe Nobel Prize for chemistry went to another trio, Carolyn R. Bertozzi, Morten Meldal and K. Barry Sharpless \"for the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry,\" the committee stated.\r\n\r\nTogether, they created a functional form of chemistry, click chemistry, which is a \"straightforward route\" to building molecular functions. Dr. Bertozzi \"took click chemistry to a new level\" and started utilizing it in living organisms.\r\n\r\nDr. Bertozzi is the eighth woman chemist to be awarded the prize, while Dr. Sharpless is the fifth scientist to be awarded two Nobel Prizes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiterature: Annie Ernaux\r\nFrench novelist Annie Ernaux took home the Nobel Prize in literature as the 17th woman to win the award since 1901. The author, who is 82, has been writing autobiographical stories about feminism and the human experience for more than 50 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeace work: Ales Bialiatski, human rights organizations Center for Civil Liberties and Memorial\r\nThe 2022 Nobel Peace Prize is shared by three recipients: Belarus-based human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski, Ukrainian human rights organization Center for Civil Liberties and Russian human rights organization Memorial.\r\n\r\nBialiatski is the founder of Belarus human rights organization Viasna, or Spring, which was born in 1996 in response to authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenko, per CNN. The longtime advocate was arrested in 2020 after participating in protests against Lukashenko. According to the Nobel committee, Bialiatski is still detained without trial, but \"despite tremendous personal hardship, Mr. Bialiatski has not yielded an inch in his fight for human rights and democracy in Belarus.\"\r\n\r\nThe Center for Civil Liberties has been working tirelessly since Russia invaded Ukraine to \"identify and document Russian war crimes against the Ukrainian civilian population\" and is playing a key role in \"holding the guilty parties accountable for their crimes,\" the committee stated.\r\n\r\nThe third recipient, Memorial, was founded in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union to expose abuse and injustice. It was shut down by a Russian court in December 2021 for violating Russia's \"foreign agent\" law.\r\n\r\nRelated: Celebrate Bob Dylan's Nobel Prize Win With These 20 Inspiring Quotes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomics: Ben Bernanke, Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig\r\nThe Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2022 was awarded to Ben S. Bernanke, Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig \"for research on banks and financial crises,\" the Nobel Prize committee announced on Monday.\r\n\r\nBernanke was the chair of the Federal Reserve from 2006 to 2014, per ABC News, while Diamond and Dybvig work as professors at The University of Chicago and Washington University in St. Louis, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy studying the history of American economics, particularly the Great Depression of the 1930s, they improved how we understand the role of banks during times of hardship and the bank's impact on societal functions.\r\n\r\n\"The laureates' insights have improved our ability to avoid both serious crises and expensive bailouts,\" Tore Ellingsen, Chair of the Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences, said in a press release.\r\n\r\n",    "date":"10-10-2022",    "url":"https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/who-are-the-2022-nobel-prize-winners-meet-the-recipients/436810"}

Thus, culture includes language, ideas, beliefs, customs, codes, institutions, tools, techniques, works of art, rituals, and ceremonies, among other elements.\r\n\r\nThe existence and use of culture depends upon an ability possessed by humans alone. This ability has been called variously the capacity for rational or abstract thought, but a good case has been made for rational behaviour among subhuman animals, and the meaning of abstract is not sufficiently explicit or precise. The term symboling has been proposed as a more suitable name for the unique mental ability of humans, consisting of assigning to things and events certain meanings that cannot be grasped with the senses alone. Articulate speech—language—is a good example. The meaning of the word dog is not inherent in the sounds themselves; it is assigned, freely and arbitrarily, to the sounds by human beings. Holy water, “biting one’s thumb” at someone (Romeo and Juliet, Act I, scene 1), or fetishes are other examples. Symboling is a kind of behaviour objectively definable and should not be confused with symbolizing, which has an entirely different meaning.\r\n\r\nThe concept of culture\r\nVarious definitions of culture\r\nWhat has been termed the classic definition of culture was provided by the 19th-century English anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor in the first paragraph of his Primitive Culture (1871):\r\n\r\nCulture . . . is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\r\n\r\nIn Anthropology (1881) Tylor made it clear that culture, so defined, is possessed by man alone. This conception of culture served anthropologists well for some 50 years. With the increasing maturity of anthropological science, further reflections upon the nature of their subject matter and concepts led to a multiplication and diversification of definitions of culture. In Culture: A Critical Review of Concepts and Definitions (1952), U.S. anthropologists A.L. Kroeber and Clyde Kluckhohn cited 164 definitions of culture, ranging from “learned behaviour” to “ideas in the mind,” “a logical construct,” “a statistical fiction,” “a psychic defense mechanism,” and so on. The definition—or the conception—of culture that is preferred by Kroeber and Kluckhohn and also by a great many other anthropologists is that culture is an abstraction or, more specifically, “an abstraction from behaviour.”\r\n\r\nThese conceptions have defects or shortcomings. The existence of behavioral traditions—that is, patterns of behaviour transmitted by social rather than by biologic hereditary means—has definitely been established for nonhuman animals. “Ideas in the mind” become significant in society only as expressed in language, acts, and objects. “A logical construct” or “a statistical fiction” is not specific enough to be useful. The conception of culture as an abstraction led, first, to a questioning of the reality of culture (inasmuch as abstractions were regarded as imperceptible) and, second, to a denial of its existence; thus, the subject matter of nonbiological anthropology, “culture,” was defined out of existence, and without real, objective things and events in the external world there can be no science.\r\n\r\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.\r\nSubscribe Now\r\nKroeber and Kluckhohn were led to their conclusion that culture is an abstraction by reasoning that if culture is behaviour it, ipso facto, becomes the subject matter of psychology; therefore, they concluded that culture “is an abstraction from concrete behavior but is not itself behavior.” But what, one might ask, is an abstraction of a marriage ceremony or a pottery bowl, to use Kroeber and Kluckhohn’s examples? This question poses difficulties that were not adequately met by these authors. A solution was perhaps provided by Leslie A. White in the essay “The Concept of Culture” (1959). The issue is not really whether culture is real or an abstraction, he reasoned; the issue is the context of the scientific interpretation.\r\n\r\nWhen things and events are considered in the context of their relation to the human organism, they constitute behaviour; when they are considered not in terms of their relation to the human organism but in their relationship to one another, they become culture by definition. The mother-in-law taboo is a complex of concepts, attitudes, and acts. When one considers them in their relationship to the human organism—that is, as things that the organism does—they become behaviour by definition. When, however, one considers the mother-in-law taboo in its relationship to the place of residence of a newly married couple, to the customary division of labour between the sexes, to their respective roles in the society’s mode of subsistence and offense and defense, and these in turn to the technology of the society, the mother-in-law taboo becomes, again by definition, culture. This distinction is precisely the one that students of words have made for many years. When words are considered in their relationship to the human organism—that is, as acts—they become behaviour. But when they are considered in terms of their relationship to one another—producing lexicon, grammar, syntax, and so forth—they become language, the subject matter not of psychology but of the science of linguistics. Culture, therefore, is the name given to a class of things and events dependent upon symboling (i.e., articulate speech) that are considered in a kind of extra-human context.\r\n\r\nUniversalist approaches to culture and the human mind\r\nCulture, as noted above, is due to an ability possessed by man alone. The question of whether the difference between the mind of man and that of the lower animals is one of kind or of degree has been debated for many years, and even today reputable scientists can be found on both sides of this issue. But no one who holds the view that the difference is one of degree has adduced any evidence to show that nonhuman animals are capable, to any degree whatever, of a kind of behaviour that all human beings exhibit. This kind of behaviour may be illustrated by the following examples: remembering the sabbath to keep it holy, classifying one’s relatives and distinguishing one class from another (such as uncles from cousins), defining and prohibiting incest, and so on. There is no reason or evidence that leads one to believe that any animal other than man can have or be brought to any appreciation or comprehension whatever of such meanings and acts. There is, as Tylor argued long ago, a “mental gulf that divides the lowest savage from the highest ape” (Anthropology).\r\n\r\nIn line with the foregoing distinction, human behaviour is to be defined as behaviour consisting of, or dependent upon, symboling rather than upon anything else that Homo sapiens does; coughing, yawning, stretching, and the like are not human.\r\n\r\nNext to nothing is yet known about the neuroanatomy of symboling. Man is characterized by a very large brain, considered both absolutely and relatively, and it is reasonable—and even obligatory—to believe that the central nervous system, especially the forebrain, is the locus of the ability to symbol. But how it does this and with what specific mechanisms remain to be discovered. One is thus led to the conclusion that at some point in the evolution of primates a threshold was reached in some line, or lines, when the ability to symbol was realized and made explicit in overt behaviour. There is no intermediate stage, logical or neurological, between symboling and nonsymboling; an individual or a species is capable of symboling, or he or it is not. The life of Helen Keller makes this clear: when, through the aid of her teacher, Anne Sullivan, Keller was enabled to escape from the isolation to which her blindness and deafness had consigned her and to effect contact with the world of human meanings and values, the transformation was instantaneous.\r\n\r\nEvolution of “minding”\r\nBut even if almost nothing is known about the neuroanatomy of symboling, a great deal is known about the evolution of mind (or “minding,” if mind is considered as a process rather than a thing), in which one finds symboling as the characteristic of a particular stage of development. The evolution of minding can be traced in the following sequence of stages. First is the simple reflexive stage, in which behaviour is determined by the intrinsic properties of both the organism and the thing reacted to—for example, the contraction of the pupil of the eye under increased stimulation by light. Second is the conditioned reflex stage, in which the response is elicited not by properties intrinsic in the stimulus but by meanings that the stimulus has acquired for the responding organism through experience—for example, Pavlov’s dog’s salivary glands responding to the sound of a bell. Third is the instrumental stage, as exemplified by a chimpanzee knocking down a banana with a stick. Here the response is determined by the intrinsic properties of the things involved (banana, stick, chimpanzee’s neurosensory-muscular system); but a new element has been introduced into behaviour, namely, the exercise of control by the reacting organism over things in the external world. And, finally, there is the symbol stage, in which the configuration of behaviour involves nonintrinsic meanings, as has already been suggested.\r\n\r\nThese four stages exhibit a characteristic of the evolution of all living things: a movement in the direction of making life more secure and enduring. In the first stage the organism distinguishes between the beneficial, the injurious, and the neutral, but it must come into direct contact with the object or event in question to do so. In the second stage the organism may react at a distance, as it were—that is, through an intermediate stimulus. The conditioned reflex brings signs into the life process; one thing or event may serve as an indication of something else—food, danger, and so forth. And, since anything can serve as a sign of anything else (a green triangle can mean food, sex, or an electric shock to the laboratory rat), the reactions of the organism are emancipated from the limitations that stage one imposes upon living things, namely, the intrinsic properties of things. The possibility of obtaining life-sustaining things and of avoiding life-destroying things is thus much enhanced, and the security and continuity of life are correspondingly increased. But in stage two the organism still plays a subordinate role to the external world; it does not and cannot determine the significance of the intermediary stimulus: the bark of a distant dog to the rabbit or the sound of the bell to Pavlov’s dog. This meaning is determined by things and events in the external world (or in the laboratory by the experimenter). In stages one and two, therefore, the organism is at the mercy of the external world in this respect.\r\n\r\nIn the third stage the element of control over environment is introduced. The ape who obtains food by means of a stick (tool) is not subordinate to his situation. He does not merely undergo a situation; he dominates it. His behaviour is not determined by the juxtaposition of things and events; on the contrary, the juxtaposition is determined by the ape. He is confronted with alternatives, and he makes choices. The configuration of behaviour in stage three is constructed within the dynamic organism of the ape and then imposed upon the external world.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of minding is a cumulative process; the achievements of each stage are carried on into the succeeding one or ones. The fourth stage reintroduces the factor of nonintrinsic meanings to the advances made in stages two and three. Stage four is the stage of symboling, of articulate speech. Thus, one observes two aspects of the evolution of minding, both of which contribute to the security and survivability of life: the emancipation of behaviour from limitations imposed upon it by the external world and increased control over the environment. To be sure, neither emancipation nor control becomes complete, but quantitative increase is significant.\r\n\r\nEvolution of culture\r\nThe direction of biologic evolution toward greater expansion and security of life can be seen from another point of view: the advance from instinctive behaviour (i.e., responses determined by intrinsic properties of the organism) to learned and freely variable behaviour, patterns of which may be acquired and transmitted from one individual and generation to another, and finally to a system of things and events, the essence of which is meanings that cannot be comprehended by the senses alone. This system is, of course, culture, and the species is the human species. Culture is a man-made environment, brought into existence by the ability to symbol.\r\n\r\nOnce established, culture has a life of its own, so to speak; that is, it is a continuum of things and events in a cause and effect relationship; it flows down through time from one generation to another. Since its inception 1,000,000 or more years ago, this culture—with its language, beliefs, tools, codes, and so on—has had an existence external to each individual born into it. The function of this external, man-made environment is to make life secure and enduring for the society of human beings living within the cultural system. Thus, culture may be seen as the most recent, the most highly developed means of promoting the security and continuity of life, in a series that began with the simple reflex.\r\n\r\nSociety preceded culture; society, conceived as the interaction of living beings, is coextensive with life itself. Man’s immediate prehuman ancestors had societies, but they did not have culture. Studies of monkeys and apes have greatly enlarged scientific knowledge of their social life—and, by inference, the scientific conception of the earliest human societies. Data derived from paleontological sources and from accumulating studies of living, nonhuman primates are now fairly abundant, and hypotheses derived from these are numerous and varied in detail. A fair summary of them may be made as follows: The growth of the primate brain was stimulated by life in the trees, specifically, by eye-hand coordinations involved in swinging from limb to limb and by manipulating food with the hands (as among the insectivorous lemurs). Descent to the ground, as a consequence of deforestation or increase in body size (which would tend to restrict arboreal locomotion and increase the difficulty of obtaining enough food to supply increased need), and the assumption of erect posture were other significant steps in biologic evolution and the eventual emergence of culture. Some theories reject the arboreal stage in man’s evolutionary past, but this does not seriously affect the overall conception of his development.\r\n\r\nThe Australopithecines of Africa, extinct manlike higher primates about which reliable knowledge is very considerable today, exemplify the stage of erect posture in primate evolution. Erect posture freed the arms and hands from their earlier function of locomotion and made possible an extensive and versatile use of tools. Again, the eye-hand-object coordinations involved in tool using stimulated the growth of the brain, especially the forebrain. It is not possible to determine on the basis of paleontological evidence the precise point at which the ability to symbol (specifically, articulate speech) was realized, as expressed in overt behaviour. It is believed by some that man’s prehuman ancestors used tools habitually and that habit became custom through the transmission of tool using from one generation to another long before articulate speech came into being. In fact, some theorists hold, the customary use of tools became a powerful stimulus in the development of a brain that was capable of symboling or articulate speech.\r\n\r\nThe introjection of symboling into primate social life was revolutionary. Everything was transformed, everything acquired new meaning; the symbol added a new dimension to primate—now human—existence. An ax was no longer merely a tool with which to chop; it could become a symbol of authority. Mating became marriage, and all social relationships between parents and children and brothers and sisters became moral obligations, duties, rights, and privileges. The world of nature, from the stones beside the path to the stars in their courses, became alive and conscious spirits. “And all that I beheld respired with inward meaning” (Wordsworth). The anthropoid had at last become a man.\r\n\r\nRelativist approaches to sociocultural systems\r\nThus far in this article, culture has been considered in general, as the possession of all mankind. Now it is appropriate to turn to particular cultures, or sociocultural systems. Human beings, like other animal species, live in societies, and each society possesses culture. It has long been customary for ethnologists to speak of Seneca culture, Eskimo culture, North American Plains culture, and so on—that is, the culture of a particular society (Seneca) or an indefinite number of societies (Eskimo) or the cultures found in or characteristic of a topographic area (the North American Plains). There is no objection to this usage as a convenient means of reference: “Seneca culture” is the culture that the Seneca tribe possesses at a particular time. Similarly, Eskimo culture refers to a class of cultures, and Plains culture refers to a type of culture. What is needed is a term that defines culture precisely in its particular manifestations for the purpose of scientific study, and for this the term sociocultural system has been proposed. It is defined as the culture possessed by a distinguishable and autonomous group (society) of human beings, such as a tribe or a modern nation. Cultural elements may pass freely from one system to another (cultural diffusion), but the boundary provided by the distinction between one system and another (Seneca, Cayuga; United States, Japan) makes it possible to study the system at any given time or over a period of time.\r\n\r\nEvery human society, therefore, has its own sociocultural system: a particular and unique expression of human culture as a whole. Every sociocultural system possesses the components of human culture as a whole—namely, technological, sociological, and ideological elements. But sociocultural systems vary widely in their structure and organization. These variations are attributable to differences among physical habitats and the resources that they offer or withhold for human use; to the range of possibilities inherent in various areas of activity, such as language or the manufacture and use of tools; and to the degree of development. The biologic factor of man may, for purposes of analysis and comparison of sociocultural systems, be considered as a constant. Although the equality or inequality of races, or physical types, of mankind has not been established by science, all evidence and reason lead to the conclusion that, whatever differences of native endowment may exist, they are insignificant as compared with the overriding influence of the external tradition that is culture.\r\n\r\nCulture and personality\r\nSince the infant of the human species enters the world cultureless, his behaviour—his attitudes, values, ideals, and beliefs, as well as his overt motor activity—is powerfully influenced by the culture that surrounds him on all sides. It is almost impossible to exaggerate the power and influence of culture upon the human animal. It is powerful enough to hold the sex urge in check and achieve premarital chastity and even voluntary vows of celibacy for life. It can cause a person to die of hunger, though nourishment is available, because some foods are branded unclean by the culture. And it can cause a person to disembowel or shoot himself to wipe out a stain of dishonour. Culture is stronger than life and stronger than death. Among subhuman animals, death is merely the cessation of the vital processes of metabolism, respiration, and so on. In the human species, however, death is also a concept; only man knows death. But culture triumphs over death and offers man eternal life. Thus, culture may deny satisfactions on the one hand while it fulfills desires on the other.\r\n\r\nThe predominant emphasis, perhaps, in studies of culture and personality has been the inquiry into the process by which the individual personality is formed as it develops under the influence of its cultural milieu. But the individual biologic organism is itself a significant determinant in the development of personality. The mature personality is, therefore, a function of both biologic and cultural factors, and it is virtually impossible to distinguish these factors from each other and to evaluate the magnitude of each in particular cases. If the cultural factor were a constant, personality would vary with the variations of the neurosensory-glandular-muscular structure of the individual. But there are no tests that can indicate, for example, precisely how much of the taxicab driver’s ability to make change is due to innate endowment and how much to cultural experience. Therefore, the student of culture and personality is driven to work with “modal personalities,” that is, the personality of the typical Crow Indian or the typical Frenchman insofar as this can be determined. But it is of interest, theoretically at least, to note that even if both factors, the biologic and the cultural, were constant—which they never are in actuality—variations of personality would still be possible. Within the confines of these two constants, individuals might undergo a number of profound experiences in different chronological permutations. For example, two young women might have the same experiences of (1) having a baby, (2) graduating from college, and (3) getting married. But the effect of sequence (1), (2), (3) upon personality development would be quite different than that of sequence (2), (3), (1).\r\n\r\nCultural comparisons\r\nEthnocentrism\r\nEthnocentrism is the name given to a tendency to interpret or evaluate other cultures in terms of one’s own. This tendency has been, perhaps, more prevalent in modern nations than among preliterate tribes. The citizens of a large nation, especially in the past, have been less likely to observe people in another nation or culture than have been members of small tribes who are well acquainted with the ways of their culturally diverse neighbours. Thus, the American tourist could report that Londoners drive “on the wrong side of the street” or an Englishman might find some customs on the Continent “queer” or “boorish,” merely because they are different. Members of a Pueblo tribe in the American Southwest, on the other hand, might be well acquainted with cultural differences not only among other Pueblos but also in non-Pueblo tribes such as the Navajo and Apache.\r\n\r\nEthnocentrism became prominent among many Europeans after the discovery of the Americas, the islands of the Pacific, and the Far East. Even anthropologists might characterize all preliterate peoples as being without religion (as did Sir John Lubbock) or as having a “prelogical mentality” (as did Lucien Lévy-Bruhl) merely because their ways of thinking did not correspond with those of the culture of western Europe. Thus, inhabitants of non-Western cultures, particularly those lacking the art of writing, were widely described as being immoral, illogical, queer, or just perverse (“Ye Beastly Devices of ye Heathen”).\r\n\r\nCultural relativism\r\nIncreased knowledge led to or facilitated a deeper understanding and, with it, a finer appreciation of cultures quite different from one’s own. When it was understood that universal needs could be served with culturally diverse means, that worship might assume a variety of forms, that morality consists in conforming to ethical rules of conduct but does not inhere in the rules themselves, a new view emerged that each culture should be understood and appreciated in terms of itself. What is moral in one culture might be immoral or ethically neutral in another. For example, it was not immoral to kill a baby girl at birth or an aged grandparent who was nonproductive when it was impossible to obtain enough food for all; or wife lending among the Eskimo might be practiced as a gesture of hospitality, a way of cementing a friendship and promoting mutual aid in a harsh and dangerous environment, and thus may acquire the status of a high moral value.\r\n\r\nThe view that elements of a culture are to be understood and judged in terms of their relationship to the culture as a whole—a doctrine known as cultural relativism—led to the conclusion that the cultures themselves could not be evaluated or graded as higher and lower, superior or inferior. If it was unwarranted to say that patriliny (descent through the male line) was superior or inferior to matriliny (descent through the female line), if it was unjustified or meaningless to say that monogamy was better or worse than polygamy, then it was equally unsound or meaningless to say that one culture was higher or superior to another. A large number of anthropologists subscribed to this view; they argued that such judgments were subjective and therefore unscientific.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, true that some values are imponderable and some criteria are subjective. Are people in modern Western culture happier than the Aborigines of Australia? Is it better to be a child than an adult, alive than dead? These certainly are not questions for science. But to say that the culture of the ancient Mayas was not superior to or more highly developed than the crude and simple culture of the Tasmanians or to say that the culture of England in 1966 was not higher than England’s culture in 1066 is to fly in the face of science as well as of common sense.\r\n\r\nEvaluative grading\r\nCultures have ponderable values as well as imponderable, and the imponderable ones can be measured with objective, meaningful yardsticks. A culture is a means to an end: the security and continuity of life. Some kinds of culture are better means of making life secure than others. Agriculture is a better means of providing food than hunting and gathering. The productivity of human labour has been increased by machinery and by the utilization of the energy of nonhuman animals, water and wind power, and fossil fuels. Some cultures have more effective means of coping with disease than others, and this superiority is expressed mathematically in death rates. And there are many other ways in which meaningful differences can be measured and evaluations made. Thus, the proposition that cultures have ponderable values that can be measured meaningfully by objective yardsticks and arranged in a series of stages, higher and lower, is substantiated. But, it should be noted, this is not equivalent to saying that man is happier or that the dignity of the individual (an imponderable) is greater in an industrialized or agricultural sociocultural system than in one supported by human labour alone and sustained wholly by wild foods.\r\n\r\nActually, however, there is no necessary conflict between the doctrine of cultural relativism and the thesis that cultures can be objectively graded in a scientific manner. It is one thing to reject the statement that monogamy is better than polygamy and quite another to deny that one kind of sociocultural system contains a better means of providing food or combating disease than another.\r\n\r\nCultural adaptation and change\r\nEcological or environmental change\r\nEvery sociocultural system exists in a natural habitat, and, of course, this environment exerts an influence upon the cultural system. The cultures of some Eskimo groups present remarkable instances of adaptation to environmental conditions: tailored fur clothing, snow goggles, boats and harpoons for hunting sea mammals, and, in some instances, hemispherical snow houses, or igloos. Some sedentary, horticultural tribes of the upper Missouri River went out into the Great Plains and became nomadic hunters after the introduction of the horse. The culture of the Navajos underwent profound change after they acquired herds of sheep and a market for their rugs was developed. The older theories of simple environmentalism, some of which maintained that even styles of myths and tales were determined by topography, climate, flora, and other factors, are no longer in vogue. The present view is that the environment permits, at times encourages, and also prohibits the acquisition or use of certain cultural traits but otherwise does not determine culture change. The Fuegians living at the southern tip of South America, as viewed by Charles Darwin on his voyage on the Beagle, lived in a very cold, harsh environment but were virtually without both clothing and dwellings.\r\n\r\nDiffusion\r\n“Culture is contagious,” as a prominent anthropologist once remarked, meaning that customs, beliefs, tools, techniques, folktales, ornaments, and so on may diffuse from one people or region to another. To be sure, a culture trait must offer some advantage, some utility or pleasure, to be sought and accepted by a people. (Some anthropologists have assumed that basic features of social structure, such as clan organization, may diffuse, but a sounder view holds that these features involving the organic structure of the society must be developed within societies themselves.) The degree of isolation of a sociocultural system—brought about by physical barriers such as deserts, mountain ranges, and bodies of water—has, of course, an important bearing upon the ease or difficulty of diffusion. Within the limits of desirability on the one hand and the possibility of communication on the other, diffusion of culture has taken place everywhere and in all times. Archaeological evidence shows that amber from the Baltic region diffused to the Mediterranean coast; and, conversely, early coins from the Middle East found their way to northern Europe. In aboriginal North America, copper objects from northern Michigan have been found in mounds in Georgia; macaw feathers from Central America turn up in archaeological sites in northern Arizona. Some Indian tribes in northwestern regions of the United States had possessed horses, originally brought into the Southwest by Spanish explorers, years before they had ever even seen white men. The wide dispersion of tobacco, corn (maize), coffee, the sweet potato, and many other traits are conspicuous examples of cultural diffusion.\r\n\r\nAcculturation\r\nDiffusion may take place between tribes or nations that are approximately equal in political and military power and of equivalent stages of cultural development, such as the spread of the sun dance among the Plains tribes of North America. But in other instances, it takes place between sociocultural systems differing widely in this respect. Conspicuous examples of this have been instances of conquest and colonization of various regions by the nations of modern Europe. In these cases it is often said that the culture of the more highly developed nation is “imposed” upon the less developed peoples and cultures, and there is, of course, much truth in this; the acquisition of foreign culture by the subject people is called acculturation and is manifested by the indigenous populations of Latin America as well as of other regions. But even in cases of conquest, traits from the conquered peoples may diffuse to those of the more advanced cultures; examples might include, in addition to the cultivated plants cited above, individual words (coyote), musical themes, games, and art motifs.\r\n\r\nOne of the major problems of ethnology during the latter half of the 19th and the early decades of the 20th centuries was the question “How are cultural similarities in noncontiguous regions to be explained?” Did the concepts of pyramid building, mummification, and sun worship originate independently in ancient Egypt and in the Andean highlands and in Yucatán or did these traits originate in Egypt and diffuse from there to the Americas, as some anthropologists have believed? Some schools of ethnological theory have held to one view, some, to another. The 19th-century classical evolutionists (which included Edward Burnett Tylor and Lewis H. Morgan, among others) held that the mind of man is so constituted or endowed that he will develop cultures everywhere along the same lines. “Diffusionists”—those, such as Fritz Graebner and Elliot Smith, who offered grand theories about the diffusion of traits all over the world—maintained that man was inherently uninventive and that culture, once created, tended to spread everywhere. Each school tended to insist that its view was the correct one, and it would continue to hold that view unless definite proof of the contrary could be adduced.\r\n\r\nThe tendency nowadays is not to side categorically with one school as against another but to decide each case on its own merits. The consensus with regard to pyramids is that they were developed independently in Egypt and the Americas because they differ markedly in structure and function: the Egyptian pyramids were built of stone blocks and contained tombs within their interiors. The American pyramids were constructed of earth, then faced with stone, and they served as the bases of temples. The verdict with regard to the bow and arrow is that it was invented only once and subsequently diffused to all regions where it has been found. The probable antiquity of the origin of fire making, however, and the various ways of generating it—by percussion, friction, compression (fire pistons)—indicate multiple origins.\r\n\r\nEvolution\r\nEvolution of culture—that is, the development of forms through time—has taken place. No amount of diffusion of picture writing could of itself, for instance, produce the alphabetic system of writing; as Tylor demonstrated so well, the art of writing has developed through a series of stages, which began with picture writing, progressed to hieroglyphic writing, and culminated in alphabetic writing. In the realm of social organization there was a development from territorial groups composed of families to segmented societies (clans and larger groupings). Sociocultural evolution, like biologic evolution, exhibits a progressive differentiation of structure and specialization of function.\r\n\r\nA misunderstanding has arisen with regard to the relationship between evolution and diffusion. It has been argued, for example, that the theory of cultural evolution was unsound because some peoples skipped a stage in a supposedly determined sequence; for example, some African tribes, as a consequence of diffusion, went from the Stone Age to the Iron Age without an intermediate age of copper and bronze. But the classical evolutionists did not maintain that peoples, or societies, had to pass through a fixed series of stages in the course of development, but that tools, techniques, institutions—in short, culture—had to pass through the stages. The sequence of stages of writing did not mean that a society could not acquire the alphabet without working its way through hieroglyphic writing; it was obvious that many peoples did skip directly to the alphabet.\r\n\r\nApproaches to the study of culture\r\nViewing culture in terms of patterns and configurations\r\nCultural traits\r\nThe concept of culture embraces the culture of mankind as a whole. An understanding of human culture is facilitated, however, by analyzing “the complex whole” into component parts or categories. In somewhat the same sense that the atom has been regarded as the unit of matter, the cell as the unit of life, so the culture trait is generally regarded as the unit of culture. A trait may be an object (knife), a way of doing something (weaving), a belief (in spirits), or an attitude (the so-called horror of incest). But, within the category of culture, each trait is related to other traits. A distinguishable and relatively self-contained cluster of traits is conventionally called a culture complex. The association of traits in a complex may be of a functional and mechanical nature, such as horse, saddle, bridle, quirt, and the like, or it may lie in conceptional or emotional associations, such as the acts and attitudes involved in seclusion in a menstrual hut or retrieving a heart that has been stolen by witches.\r\n\r\nCultural areas\r\nThe relationship between an actual culture and its habitat is always an intimate one, and therefore one finds a more or less close correlation between kind of habitat and type of culture. This results in the concept of culture area. This conception goes back at least as far as the early 19th century, but it was first brought into prominence by the U.S. anthropologist Clark Wissler in The American Indian (1917) and Man and Culture (1923). He divided the Indian cultures (as they were in the latter half of the 19th century) into geographic cultural regions: the Caribou area of northern Canada; the Northwest coast, characterized by the use of salmon and cedar; the Great Plains, where tribes hunted bison with the horse; the Pueblo area of the Southwest; and so on. Others later distinguished culture areas in other continents.\r\n\r\nCultural types\r\nAppreciation of the relationship between culture and topographic area suggests the concept of culture type, such as hunting and gathering or a special way of hunting—for example, the use of the horse in bison hunting in the Plains or the method of hunting of sea mammals among the Eskimo; pastoral cultures centred upon sheep, cattle, reindeer, and so on; and horticulture (with digging stick and hoe) and agriculture (with ox-drawn plow). Less common are trading cultures such as are found in Melanesia or specialized production of some object for trade, such as pottery, bronze axes, or salt, as was the case in Luzon.\r\n\r\nConfiguration and pattern, especially the latter, are concepts closely related to culture area and culture type. All of them have one thing in common; they view culture not in terms of its individual components, or traits, but as meaningful organizations of traits: areas, occupations, configurations (art, mathematics, physics), or patterns (in which psychological factors are the bases of organization). Clark Wissler’s “universal culture pattern” was a recognition of the fact that all particular and actual cultures possess the same general categories: language, art, social organization, religion, technology, and so on.\r\n\r\nViewing culture in terms of institutional structure and functions\r\nSocial organization\r\nA sociocultural system presents itself under two aspects: structure and function. As culture evolves, sociocultural systems (like biologic systems) become more differentiated structurally and more specialized functionally, proceeding from the simple to the complex. Systems on the lowest stage of development have only two significant kinds of parts: the local territorial group and the family. There is a corresponding minimum of specialization, limited, with but few exceptions, to division of function, or labour, along sex lines and to division between children and adults. The exceptions are headmen and shamans; they are special organs, so to speak, in the body politic. The headman is a mechanism of social integration, direction, and control, expressing, however, the consensus of the band. The shaman, though a self-appointed priest or magician, is also an instrument of society; he may be regarded as the first specialist in the history of human society.\r\n\r\nAll human societies are divided into classes and segments. Class is defined as one of an indefinite number of groupings each of which differs in composition from the other or others, such as men and women; married, widowed, and divorced; children and adults. Segment is defined as one of an indefinite number of groupings all of which are alike in structure and function: families, lineages, clans, and so on. On more advanced levels of development there are occupational classes, such as farmers, pastoralists, artisans, metalworkers, and scribes, and territorial segments, such as wards, barrios, counties, and states.\r\n\r\nSegmentation is a cultural process essential to the evolution of culture; it is a means of increasing the size of a society or a grouping within a sociocultural system (such as an army) and therefore of increasing its power to make life secure, without suffering a corresponding loss of effectiveness through diminished solidarity; segmentation is a means of maintaining solidarity at the same time that it enlarges the social grouping. A tribe could not increase in size beyond a certain point without resorting to segmentation: the formation of lineages, clans, and the like. The word clannish points to one of the functions of segments in general: the fostering of solidarity. Tribes become segments in confederacies; and above the tribal level, the evolution of civil society employs barrios, demes, counties, and states in its process of segmentation. In present-day society, the army and the church offer illuminating examples of increased size and sustained solidarity proceeding hand in hand.\r\n\r\nEconomic systems\r\nDivision of labour along occupational lines is rare, although not wholly lacking, in preliterate societies—despite a widespread notion that one member of a tribe specializes in making arrows, which he exchanges for moccasins made by another specialist. Occupational groupings were virtually lacking in all cultural systems of aboriginal North America, for example. Guilds of metalworkers are found in some African tribes and specialists in canoe making and tattooing existed in Polynesia. But it is not until the transition from preliterate society, based upon ties of kinship, to civil society, based upon property relations and territorial distinctions (the state), that division of labour along occupational lines becomes extensive. On this level there are found many kinds of specialists: metalworkers, scribes, astrologers, soldiers, dancers, musicians, alchemists, prostitutes, eunuchs, and so forth.\r\n\r\nProduction of goods is everywhere followed by distribution and exchange. Among the Kurnai of Australia, for example, game was divided and distributed as follows: the hunter who killed a wallaby, for example, kept the head; his father received the ribs on the right side, his mother the ribs on the left side, plus the backbone, and so on; the various parts of the animal went to various classes of relatives in accordance with fixed, traditional rules.\r\n\r\nDistribution along kinship lines constitutes a system of circulation and exchange within the tribe as a whole, for everyone is a relative of everyone else. It takes the form of bestowing gifts to relatives on all sorts of occasions—such as birth, initiation, marriage, death. In some cases there is an exchange of goods on the spot, but more often A gives something to B who gives A a gift at a later date. All this takes place in the network of rights and obligations among kindred; one has both an obligation to give and a right to receive on certain occasions and in certain contexts. The whole process is one of mutual aid and cooperation.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of this form of distribution and exchange is that the recipient receives kinds of things that he already has; each household has the same kinds of foods, utensils, ornaments, and other things that every other household has. Why, then, it might be asked, does this form of exchange take place? Two reasons may be distinguished. First, this kind of exchange fortifies ties of kinship and mutual aid—as neighbourhood exchange among households in modern American culture initiates friendships that in times of need constitute mutual aid. Second, this system of circulation of goods is in effect a system of social security: a household in need, due to illness or accident, receives help from the community (“No household can starve as long as others have corn,” as the Iroquois put it). Here we have an economic system subordinated to the welfare of the society as a whole.\r\n\r\nExchange or circulation of goods and services (a basket is the material form of “a service,” that is, human labour) must, of course, take place in sociocultural systems where division of labour finds expression in specialization: the ironworker must obtain food; the horticulturalist needs an iron hoe.\r\n\r\nExchange of goods between sociocultural systems is universal and takes place on the lowest levels of cultural development. In some instances it is the only form of nonhostile communication: in the so-called silent trade the actual exchange takes place in a neutral zone without the presence of the participating parties. Archaeological evidence shows that intergroup exchange occurred in remote times and over great distances, as already noted above in the discussion of diffusion.\r\n\r\nAn interesting form of the circulation of goods—usually referred to as redistribution—occurs among more highly developed tribes. The head of the sociopolitical system, that is, the chief or priest-chief, imposes levies upon all households, thus acquiring a large amount of goods—food, utensils, art objects, and so on—which he then redistributes to the households of the tribe. This may take the form and occasion of ceremonies and feasts or distribution may be made in cases of need. This widespread and interesting form of redistribution serves the same ends as those served by distribution as a function of the kinship system, namely, fostering solidarity and social security—an equitable distribution that tends to iron out inequalities among households.\r\n\r\nSome economic concepts in modern Western culture do not correspond closely with conceptions and customs in many preliterate societies. Ownership is a case in point. Complete possession of and exclusive right to use something in an economic context, such as land, a dwelling, or a boat, is rare, if not wholly lacking, in preliterate societies (although one might have exclusive rights to a dream, spell, or charm). In general, one has merely the right to use or occupy a tract of land or a house; when its use has terminated, anyone can take it over. In some societies it might be said that a boat “belonged” to the men who made it or even to the individual who initiated its construction. But anyone else in the community would have the right to use it when the “owners” (the men who made it) were not using it. It is the right to use, rather than exclusive and absolute possession, that is significant; there is no such thing as absentee ownership in primitive society.\r\n\r\nA band or tribe “holds” the land it occupies; here again, it is tenure rather than ownership that is significant; the land “belongs” to Nature, or Mother Earth; people merely hold and use it. There is usually an intimate relationship between the people and “their” land. Navajo Indians fell on their knees and kissed the earth when they were returned to their former territory after forcible detention in an alien land. Land is defended against outsiders, except when they are accepted as guests, but the significant thing is not that the outsiders do not own the land but that they pose a threat to those who occupy it.\r\n\r\nIn some tribes there is a distinct conception that the land held “belongs” to the tribe, the chief of which allots plots or tracts to individuals or households for their use. But when use terminates, the land reverts to the tribal domain.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the 19th century there was considerable discussion of “primitive communism.” This doctrine came to be interpreted as meaning that private property, the private right to hold or use, was nonexistent in primitive society. It was extended also to communism in wives and children in some tribes; this was interpreted to be a vestige of a former stage of “primordial promiscuity.” Many ethnologists, however, launched a vigorous attack upon “the doctrine of primitive communism.” Some of the conceptions of earlier anthropologists—such as group marriage—were shown to be unwarranted in the light of later research.\r\n\r\nToday, with these polemics well in the past, the situation with regard to property rights in tribal societies may be summarized as follows. Tenure and use, rather than ownership in fee simple, were the significant concepts and practices. Private, or personal, possession of goods and use of land were recognized. But possession and right were qualified by the rights and obligations of kinship: one had an obligation both to give and to receive within the body of kindred, according to specific rules. In a de facto sense, things belonged to the body of kindred; rights of possession and use were regulated by customs of kinship. In some cultures a borrower was not obliged to return an object borrowed, on the theory that if a person could afford to lend something, he relinquished his right to its possession. The mode of life in preliterate society, based upon kinship and functioning in accordance with the principles of cooperation and mutual aid, did indeed justify the adjective communal; it was the noun communism that was resented—if not feared—because of its Marxist connotation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important, as well as characteristic, features of the economic life of preliterate societies, as contrasted with modern civilizations, is this: no individual and no class or group in tribal society was denied access to the resources of nature; all were free to exploit them. This is, of course, in sharp contrast to civil society in which private ownership by some, or a class, is the means of excluding others—slaves, serfs, a proletariat—from the exploitation and enjoyment of the resources of nature. It is this freedom of access, the freedom to exploit and to enjoy the resources of nature, that has given primitive society its characteristics of freedom and equality. And, being based upon kinship ties, it had fraternity as well.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\nIn the human species individuals are equipped with fewer instincts than is the case in many nonhuman species. And, as already noted, they are born cultureless. Therefore an infant Homo sapiens must learn a very great deal and acquire a vast number of conditioned reflexes and habit patterns in order to live effectively, not only in society but in a particular kind of sociocultural system, be it Tibetan, Eskimo, or French. This process, taken as a whole, is called socialization (occasionally, enculturation)—the making of a social being out of one that was at birth wholly individualistic and egoistic.\r\n\r\nEducation in its broadest sense may properly be regarded as the process by which the culture of a sociocultural system is impressed or imposed upon the plastic, receptive infant. It is this process that makes continuity of culture possible. Education, formal and informal, is the specific means of socialization. By informal education is meant the way a child learns to adapt his behaviour to that of others, to be like others, to become a member of a group. By formal education is meant the intentional and more or less systematic effort to affect the behaviour of others by transmitting elements of culture to them, be it knowledge or belief, patterns of behaviour, or ideals and values. These attempts may be overt or covert. The teacher may make his purpose apparent, even emphatic, to the learner. But much education is effected in an unobtrusive way, without teacher or learner being aware that culture is being transmitted. Thus, in myths and tales, certain characters are presented as heroes or villains; certain traits are extolled, others are deplored or denounced. The impressionable child acquires ideals and values, an image of the good or the bad.\r\n\r\nThe growing child is immersed in the fountain of informal education constantly; the formal education tends to be periodic. Many sociocultural systems distinguish rather sharply a series of stages in the education and development of full-fledged men and women. First there is infancy, during which perhaps the most profound and enduring influences of a person’s life are brought to bear. Weaning ushers in a new stage, that of childhood, during which boys and girls become distinguished from each other. Puberty rites transform children into men and women. These rites vary enormously in emphasis and content. Sometimes they include whipping, isolation, scarification, or circumcision. Very often the ritual is accompanied by explicit instruction in the mythology and lore of the tribe and in ethical codes. Such rituals as confirmation and Bar Mitzvah in modern Western culture belong to the category of puberty rites.\r\n\r\nWith marriage come instruction and admonition, appropriate to the occasion, from elder relatives and, in more advanced cultures, from priests. In some sociocultural systems men may become members of associations or sodalities: men’s clubs, warrior societies, secret societies of magic or medicine. In some cases it is said that in passing through initiation rites a person is “born again.” Women also may belong to sodalities, and in some instances they may become members of secret, magical societies along with men.\r\n\r\nReligion and belief\r\nMan’s oldest philosophy is animism, the doctrine that everything is alive and possesses mental faculties like those possessed by man: desire, will, purpose, anger, love, and the like. This philosophy results from man’s projection of his own self, his psyche, into other things and beings, inanimate and living, without being aware of this projection. “To the Omaha,” wrote anthropologist Alice Fletcher,\r\n\r\nnothing is without life: . . . He projects his own consciousness upon all things and ascribes to them experiences and characteristics with which he is familiar; . . . akin to his own conscious being.\r\n\r\n(“Wakonda,” in F.W. Hodge [ed.], Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico)\r\n\r\n“A belief in spirits is,” according to Edward Burnett Tylor, “the minimum definition of religion.” Some later students, however, made the same claim for a belief in impersonal, supernatural power, or mana (manitou, orenda, and so on). In any case, these two elements of religion are virtually worldwide and undoubtedly represent a very early stage in the development of religion. In some cultures spirits are virtually innumerable, but, in the course of time, the more important spirits become gods. Thus, there has been a tendency toward monotheism in the history of religion. The German Roman Catholic priest and anthropologist Father Wilhelm Schmidt argued not only that some primitive peoples believe in a Supreme Being but that monotheism was characteristic of the earliest and simplest cultures. Schmidt’s thesis, however, has been severely criticized by other ethnologists. Also, as Tylor pointed out many years ago, the Supreme Being of some very primitive peoples is an originator god, or a philosophical explanatory device, accountable only for the existence and structure of the world; after his work was completed, he had no further significance; he was not worshiped and played no part in the daily lives of the people.\r\n\r\nIn the past there was much discussion—and debate—about the difference between magic and religion. Both were deemed expressions of a belief in the supernatural. Some argued that religion was social (moral) whereas magic was antisocial (immoral). Another distinction was that magic was the use of supernatural power divorced from a spiritual being. The distinction between religion and magic was so beset with exceptions as to render most definitions of these terms logically imperfect. Another difficulty was the tacit assumption that different entities, religion and magic, exist per se, and therefore that “correct” definitions of them must exist also (Adam called the animal a horse because it was a horse). Much confusion and debate would have been obviated if it had been recognized (as it generally is now) that there is no such thing as a “correct” definition—all definitions are man-made and arbitrary—and that the problem is not what religion or magic are but what beliefs, events, and experiences one wishes to designate with the words religion and magic (see also magic).\r\n\r\nCustom and law\r\nSociocultural systems, like other kinds of systems, must have means of self-regulation and control in order to persist and function. In human society these means are numerous and varied. The kinship organization specifies reciprocal and correlative rights, duties, and obligations of one class of relatives to another. Codes of ethics govern the relationship of the individual to the well-being of society as a whole. Codes of etiquette regulate class structure by requiring individuals to conform to their respective classes. Custom is a general term that embraces all these mechanisms of regulation and control and even more. Custom is the name given to uniformities in sociocultural systems. Uniformities are important because they make anticipation and prediction possible; without them, orderly conduct of social life would not be possible. Custom, therefore, is a means of social regulation and control, of effecting compliance with itself in order to render effective conduct of social life possible.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of religion and magic, much effort and debate have been spent in attempts to achieve a clean-cut distinction between custom and law. There is little or no difficulty when one is concerned with the extremes of the spectrum of social control. The way that a Hopi Indian holds his corn-husk cigarette in his hand is a matter of custom rather than law, as most ethnologists would probably agree. At the other extreme, a state edict prohibiting the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages is a law, not a custom. But in other situations the distinction is far from clear, and disagreement with regard to definitions arises. For example, in marriage the obligation to wed someone within a specified group or class (endogamy) or outside a group or class (exogamy) has been called both law and custom. Probably the most useful distinction between custom and law is the following. If an infraction of a social rule or deviation from a norm is punished merely by expressions of social disapproval, gossip, ridicule, or ostracism, the rule is called custom. If, however, infractions or violations are punished by an agency, designated by society and empowered to act on its behalf, then the rule is called a law. But even here there is difficulty. The same kind of offense may be punished by custom in one society, by law in another—as in, for example, adultery, incest, miscegenation, and black magic.\r\n\r\nIt is the ethnologist, rather than the historian, who is disturbed by instances of ambiguity with regard to custom and law; in preliterate societies the distinction between the two is not always clear. But in civil societies—that is, states brought into being by the agricultural revolution and their more recent successors—the distinction is usually sharper and more apparent, though instances of sumptuary laws that prohibit the wearing of silk or that limit the length of a garment merge law and custom or reinforce the latter by the former.\r\n\r\nOne need not be unduly disturbed by the difficulty of making sharp distinctions among sociocultural phenomena and of formulating definitions. The phenomena of culture, like those of the external world in general, are what they are, and if man-made concepts and words do not correspond closely with them, one may regret the lack of fit. But it is better to do this than to distort real phenomena by trying to force them into artificial concepts and definitions.\r\n\r\nLeslie A.

Smith\r\nRelated Topics: Nobel Prize in Literature\r\nNotable Honorees: Barack Obama Winston Churchill Albert Einstein Martin Luther King, Jr.\r\nSummary\r\nRead a brief summary of this topic\r\nNobel Prize, any of the prizes (five in number until 1969, when a sixth was added) that are awarded annually from a fund bequeathed for that purpose by the Swedish inventor and industrialist Alfred Nobel. The Nobel Prizes are widely regarded as the most prestigious awards given for intellectual achievement in the world. To browse Nobel Prize winners alphabetically, chronologically, and by prize, see below.\r\n\r\nThe reverse side of the Nobel Prize medal awarded for both Physics and Chemistry.\r\nIn the will he drafted in 1895, Nobel instructed that most of his fortune be set aside as a fund for the awarding of five annual prizes “to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind.” These prizes as established by his will are the Nobel Prize for Physics, the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, the Nobel Prize for Literature, and the Nobel Prize for Peace. The first distribution of the prizes took place on December 10, 1901, the fifth anniversary of Nobel’s death. An additional award, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968 by the Bank of Sweden and was first awarded in 1969. Although not technically a Nobel Prize, it is identified with the award; its winners are announced with the Nobel Prize recipients, and the Prize in Economic Sciences is presented at the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe reverse side of the Nobel Prize medal for Physiology or Medicine.\r\nThe reverse side of the Nobel Prize medal for Literature.\r\nAfter Nobel’s death, the Nobel Foundation was set up to carry out the provisions of his will and to administer his funds. In his will, he had stipulated that four different institutions—three Swedish and one Norwegian—should award the prizes. From Stockholm, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences confers the prizes for physics, chemistry, and economics, the Karolinska Institute confers the prize for physiology or medicine, and the Swedish Academy confers the prize for literature. The Norwegian Nobel Committee based in Oslo confers the prize for peace. The Nobel Foundation is the legal owner and functional administrator of the funds and serves as the joint administrative body of the prize-awarding institutions, but it is not concerned with the prize deliberations or decisions, which rest exclusively with the four institutions.\r\n\r\nThe selection process\r\nThe prestige of the Nobel Prize stems in part from the considerable research that goes into the selection of the prizewinners. Although the winners are announced in October and November, the selection process begins in the early autumn of the preceding year, when the prize-awarding institutions invite more than 6,000 individuals to propose, or nominate, candidates for the prizes. Some 1,000 people submit nominations for each prize, and the number of nominees usually ranges from 100 to about 250. Among those nominating are Nobel laureates, members of the prize-awarding institutions themselves; scholars active in the fields of physics, chemistry, economics, and physiology or medicine; and officials and members of diverse universities and learned academies. The respondents must supply a written proposal that details their candidates’ worthiness. Self-nomination automatically disqualifies the nominee. Prize proposals must be submitted to the Nobel Committees on or before January 31 of the award year.\r\n\r\nChinese author Gao Xingjian, 2008, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature 2000.\r\nBRITANNICA QUIZ\r\nA Nobel Prize for Literature (Mostly) Quiz\r\nEvery question in this quiz—except one—is about winners of the Nobel Prize for Literature. (The exception is about a novelist who won a different Nobel Prize.) Find out how much you know about these literary Nobelists.\r\nNobel Prizes: selection process\r\nNobel Prizes: selection process\r\nOn February 1 the six Nobel Committees—one for each prize category—start their work on the nominations received. Outside experts are frequently consulted during the process in order to help the committees determine the originality and significance of each nominee’s contribution. During September and early October the Nobel Committees have accomplished their work and submit their recommendations to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the other prize-awarding institutions. A committee’s recommendation is usually but not invariably followed. The deliberations and the voting within these institutions are secret at all stages. The final decision by the awarders must be made by November 15. Prizes may be given only to individuals, except the Peace Prize, which may also be conferred upon an institution. An individual may not be nominated posthumously, but a winner who dies before receiving the prize may be awarded it posthumously, as with Dag Hammarskjöld (for peace; 1961), Erik Axel Karlfeldt (for literature; 1931), and Ralph M. Steinman (for physiology or medicine; 2011). (Steinman was named a winner several days after his death, which was unbeknownst to the Nobel Assembly. It was decided that he would remain a Nobel laureate, since the purpose of the posthumous rule was to prevent prizes being deliberately awarded to deceased individuals.) The awards may not be appealed. Official support, whether diplomatic or political, for a certain candidate has no bearing on the award process because the prize awarders, as such, are independent of the state.\r\n\r\nThe prizes\r\nNobel Prize\r\nNobel Prize\r\nNobel Prize: medal\r\nNobel Prize: medal\r\nEach Nobel Prize consists of a gold medal, a diploma bearing a citation, and a sum of money, the amount of which depends on the income of the Nobel Foundation. A Nobel Prize is either given entirely to one person, divided equally between two persons, or shared by three persons. In the latter case, each of the three persons can receive a one-third share of the prize or two together can receive a one-half share. Sometimes a prize is withheld until the following year; if not then awarded, it is paid back into the funds, which happens also when a prize is neither awarded nor reserved. Two prizes in the same field—i.e., the prize withheld from the previous year and the current year’s prize—can thus be awarded in one year. If a prize is declined or not accepted before a set date, the prize money goes back into the funds. Some prizes have been declined by their winners, and in certain instances governments have refused to allow their citizens to accept them. Those who win a prize are nevertheless entered into the list of Nobel laureates with the remark “declined the prize.” Motives for nonacceptance may vary, but most often the reason has been external pressure; for example, in 1937 Adolf Hitler forbade Germans in the future from accepting Nobel Prizes because he had been infuriated by the award of the 1935 Peace Prize to the anti-Nazi journalist Carl von Ossietzky, who at the time was a political prisoner in Germany. In some cases, the refuser later explained the real reason behind the refusal and was granted the Nobel gold medal and the diploma—but not the money, which invariably reverts to the funds after a certain period of time.\r\n\r\nThe reverse side of the Nobel Prize medal for Peace.\r\nPrizes are withheld or not awarded when no worthy candidate in the meaning of Nobel’s will can be found or when the world situation prevents the gathering of information required to reach a decision, as happened during World Wars I and II. The prizes are open to all, irrespective of nationality, race, creed, or ideology. They can be awarded more than once to the same recipient. The ceremonial presentations of the awards for physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and economics take place in Stockholm, and that for peace takes place in Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death. The laureates usually receive their prizes in person, and each presents a lecture in connection with the award ceremonies.\r\n\r\nThe obverse side of the Nobel Prize medal for Economics.\r\nThe general principles governing awards were laid down by Alfred Nobel in his will. In 1900 supplementary rules of interpretation and administration were agreed upon between the executors, representatives of the prize-awarding institutions, and the Nobel family and were confirmed by the king in council. These statutory rules have on the whole remained unchanged but have been somewhat modified in application. For example, Nobel’s stipulation that the prizes be awarded for achievements made during “the preceding year” was obviously unworkable in regard to scientists and even writers, the true significance of whose discoveries, research, or writings might not be generally apparent for several years. Nobel’s ambiguous stipulation that the literature prize be awarded to the authors of works of an “idealistic tendency” was interpreted strictly in the beginning but has gradually been interpreted more flexibly. The basis for the economics award was scientific—i.e., mathematical or statistical, rather than political or social.\r\n\r\nThe reverse side of the Nobel Prize medal for Economics.\r\nThe Nobel Prizes for physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine have generally been the least controversial, while those for literature and peace have been, by their very nature, the most exposed to critical differences. The Peace Prize has been the prize most frequently reserved or withheld.\r\n\r\n","date":"1-1-2022","url":"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nobel-Prize"}{"id":6,"title":"Medicine to Peace: These are the Nobel Prize winners in 2022","text":"The Nobel Prize announcements are taking place between October 3-10; There are six prizes in total, including prizes for Literature and Peace.\r\nSwedish geneticist Professor Svante Pääbo won the first prize - the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2022.\r\nThe Nobel physics prize goes to sleuths of 'spooky' quantum science.\r\nHow far back does your family tree reach? The winner of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine just added a few thousand years.\r\n\r\nSwedish geneticist Professor Svante Pääbo discovered the genetic identity of two of humankind’s earliest ancestors, opening a new window on human evolution in the process.\r\n\r\nHe was the first winner of this year's six Nobel Prizes that are being announced between 3 and 10 October. Here's what you need to know about his discovery - and the recipients of the other Nobel Prizes 2022, including the prizes for Literature and Peace.\r\n\r\nNobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine\r\nProf Pääbo, Director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, achieved what many scientists believed to be impossible when, in 2010, he sequenced the genome of the Neanderthal, an extinct relative of present-day humans.\r\n\r\nHe went on to discover a previously unknown branch of the human family tree by extracting DNA from a 40,000-year-old finger bone found in a cave in Siberia. The new hominid was named Denisova after the location in which the bone was discovered.\r\n\r\nA graphic showing how Professor Pääbo used DNA from bone fragments to chart human evolution.\r\nFamily tree: Professor Pääbo used DNA from bone fragments to chart human evolution.

This is a very fundamental, big discovery.\r\n\r\n“On average, you and I have one to two per cent Neanderthal DNA… [they] are our closest extinct relatives that now have been defined at the genome level. Over the years to come, this will give huge insights into human physiology.”\r\n\r\nNeanderthal people became extinct in Europe 30,000 years ago, only a few millennia after the appearance of modern humans. This prompted scientists to speculate that their disappearance may have been due to conflict with homo sapiens.\r\n\r\nHave you read?\r\nThe first African and Black winner of the 'Nobel prize for architecture' receives a hero's welcome\r\nThe world’s next big growth challenge, according to a Nobel laureate\r\nA graphic showing the evolution of humans from Denisovans to Neanderthals to modern humans.\r\nProfessor Svante Pääbo’s Nobel Prize winning research helps explain what makes us uniquely human.

It's the ninth time that a child of a Nobel laureate has also won a prize.\r\n\r\nNobel Prize in Physics\r\nScientists Alain Aspect, John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics for experiments in quantum mechanics that laid the groundwork for rapidly-developing new applications in computing and cryptography.\r\n\r\n\"Their results have cleared the way for new technology based upon quantum information,\" the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said of the laureates: Aspect, who is French, Clauser, an American and Zeilinger, an Austrian.\r\n\r\nThe scientists all conducted experiments into quantum entanglement, where two particles are linked regardless of the space between them, a field that unsettled Albert Einstein himself, who once referred to it in a letter as \"spooky action at a distance\".\r\n\r\n\"I'm very happy... I first started this work back in 1969, and I'm happy to still be alive to be able to get the prize,\" Clauser, 79, told Reuters by phone from his home in Walnut Creek, California.\r\n\r\nDISCOVER\r\nWhat is the World Economic Forum doing about the metaverse?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNobel Prize in Chemistry\r\nCarolyn Bertozzi, Morten Meldal and Barry Sharpless have won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry 'for the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry.'\r\n\r\nPast chemistry winners include well-known scientific names such as Marie Curie, who also shared the physics prize with her husband and whose eldest daughter, Irene Joliot-Curie, won the chemistry award just over two decades after her mother.\r\n\r\n“This year’s Prize in Chemistry deals with not overcomplicating matters, instead working with what is easy and simple. Functional molecules can be built even by taking a straightforward route,” says Johan Åqvist, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe award is Sharpless's second Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\nNobel Prize in Literature\r\nFrench author Annie Ernaux has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for 2022.

To date, Nobel Prizes have been awarded 609 times to 975 people and organizations, or 943 individuals and 25 organizations if you count those who have won twice.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly all Nobel Prize winners deserve to be famous but here are some of the best known:\r\n\r\nMarie Curie (Physics 1903, Chemistry 1911) for her work on radioactivity (1903) and for discovering radium and polonium (1911).\r\nAlbert Einstein (Physics 1921) “for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect”.\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross (Peace 1917, 1944, 1963).\r\nSir Alexander Fleming (Physiology or Medicine 1945) for discovering penicillin the foundation for the development of all modern antibiotics.\r\nJames Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins (Physiology or Medicine, 1962) for discovering the helix structure of DNA. The award caused controversy because it overlooked the contribution of Rosalind Franklin whose research was vital to their discovery. In 2019 Watson was stripped of the prize over comments he made about race.\r\nDr Martin Luther King, Jr. (Peace, 1964) awarded for his work on civil rights in the United States. At the time he was aged 35, the youngest man to have received the Nobel Peace Prize. He gave the $54,123 to the civil rights movement but was assassinated in 1968, just four years after receiving the award.\r\nGabriel García Márquez (Literature, 1982) for \"for his novels and short stories, in which the fantastic and the realistic are combined in a richly composed world of imagination, reflecting a continent's life and conflicts\".\r\nMikhail Gorbachev (Peace 1990) for his role in bringing the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the West to a peaceful conclusion.\r\nNelson Mandela (Peace, 1993), South Africa’s first Black president who brought about an end to apartheid and shared his prize with the country’s last white president F.W. De Klerk who handed over power peacefully.\r\nFormer US President Jimmy Carter (Peace, 2002) “for his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development”.\r\nMalala Yousafzai (Peace, 2014) an educational campaigner and the youngest ever Nobel Laureate who won the prize after being shot and severely wounded by a Taliban gunman for defying their ban on female education.

Due to some recipients receiving multiple awards, the total number of recipients is 860 individuals and 22 organizations.[1]\r\n\r\nThe present list ranks laureates under the country/countries that are stated by the Nobel Prize committee on its website.[2] The list does not distinguish between laureates who received a full prize and the majority who shared a prize.[3] Some laureates are listed under more than one country, because the official website mentions multiple countries in relation to the laureate.[4] If a country is merely mentioned as the place of birth, an asterisk (*) is used in the respective listing to indicate this.[5] In this case, the birth country is mentioned in italics at the other listings of this laureate.\r\n\r\nOrganizations are listed here if the Nobel Prize committee relates them to a single country.[6]\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nContents\r\n1\tSummary\r\n2\tNobel Prizes by category/country of birth\r\n2.1\tAlgeria\r\n2.2\tArgentina\r\n2.3\tArmenia\r\n2.4\tAustralia\r\n2.5\tAustria\r\n2.6\tBangladesh\r\n2.7\tBelarus\r\n2.8\tBelgium\r\n2.9\tBosnia and Herzegovina\r\n2.10\tBrazil\r\n2.11\tBulgaria\r\n2.12\tCanada\r\n2.13\tChile\r\n2.14\tTaiwan, (Republic of China)\r\n2.15\tChina, (People's Republic of China)\r\n2.16\tColombia\r\n2.17\tCongo, Democratic Republic\r\n2.18\tCosta Rica\r\n2.19\tCroatia\r\n2.20\tCyprus\r\n2.21\tCzech Republic\r\n2.22\tDenmark\r\n2.23\tEast Timor\r\n2.24\tEgypt\r\n2.25\tEthiopia\r\n2.26\tFaroe Islands\r\n2.27\tFinland\r\n2.28\tFrance\r\n2.29\tGermany\r\n2.30\tGhana\r\n2.31\tGreece\r\n2.32\tGuatemala\r\n2.33\tHong Kong\r\n2.34\tHungary\r\n2.35\tIceland\r\n2.36\tIndia\r\n2.37\tIran\r\n2.38\tIraq\r\n2.39\tIreland\r\n2.40\tIsrael\r\n2.41\tItaly\r\n2.42\tJapan\r\n2.43\tKenya\r\n2.44\tLebanon\r\n2.45\tLatvia\r\n2.46\tLiberia\r\n2.47\tLithuania\r\n2.48\tLuxembourg\r\n2.49\tNorth Macedonia\r\n2.50\tMexico\r\n2.51\tMyanmar (Burma)\r\n2.52\tMorocco\r\n2.53\tNetherlands\r\n2.54\tNew Zealand\r\n2.55\tNigeria\r\n2.56\tNorway\r\n2.57\tPakistan\r\n2.58\tPalestine\r\n2.59\tPeru\r\n2.60\tPhilippines\r\n2.61\tPoland\r\n2.62\tPortugal\r\n2.63\tRomania\r\n2.64\tRussia and Soviet Union\r\n2.65\tSaint Lucia\r\n2.66\tSlovenia\r\n2.67\tSouth Africa\r\n2.68\tSouth Korea\r\n2.69\tSpain\r\n2.70\tSweden\r\n2.71\tSwitzerland\r\n2.72\tTanzania\r\n2.73\tTibet\r\n2.74\tTrinidad and Tobago\r\n2.75\tTunisia\r\n2.76\tTurkey\r\n2.77\tUkraine\r\n2.78\tUnited Kingdom\r\n2.79\tUnited States\r\n2.80\tVenezuela\r\n2.81\tVietnam\r\n2.82\tYemen\r\n2.83\tYugoslavia\r\n3\tSee also\r\n4\tReferences\r\nNumber of Nobel laureates by country\r\nCountry\tNumber of Nobel laureates\r\n(Number of Nobel Prizes)\r\n United States\t403 (406)[Note 1]\r\n United Kingdom\t137 (138)[Note 2]\r\n Germany\t113\r\n France\t72 (73)[Note 3]\r\n Sweden\t33\r\n Russia/ Soviet Union\t32\r\n Japan\t29\r\n Canada\t28\r\n  Switzerland\t27\r\n Austria\t23\r\n Netherlands\t22\r\n Italy\t21\r\n Poland\t18 (19)[Note 3]\r\n Denmark\t14\r\n Hungary\t13\r\n Israel\t13\r\n Norway\t13\r\n Australia\t12\r\n India\t12\r\n Belgium\t11\r\n Ireland\t11\r\n South Africa\t11\r\n China, (People's Republic of China)\t9\r\n Spain\t8\r\n Czech Republic\t6\r\n Ukraine\t6\r\n Argentina\t5\r\n Finland\t5\r\n Romania\t5\r\n Egypt\t4\r\n Taiwan, (Republic of China)\t4[Note 4]\r\n Lithuania\t3\r\n Mexico\t3\r\n New Zealand\t3\r\n Algeria\t2\r\n Belarus\t3\r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina\t2\r\n Chile\t2\r\n Colombia\t2\r\n Croatia\t2\r\n East Timor\t2\r\n Greece\t2\r\n Guatemala\t2\r\n Liberia\t2\r\n Luxembourg\t2\r\n Pakistan\t2\r\n Portugal\t2\r\n Saint Lucia\t2\r\n Turkey\t2\r\n Yugoslavia\t2\r\n Bangladesh\t1\r\n Brazil\t1\r\n Bulgaria\t1\r\n Costa Rica\t1\r\n Cyprus\t1\r\n Democratic Republic of the Congo\t1\r\n Ethiopia\t1\r\n Faroe Islands\t1\r\n Ghana\t1\r\n Hong Kong\t1\r\n Iceland\t1\r\n Iraq\t1\r\n Iran\t1\r\n Kenya\t1\r\n Latvia\t1\r\n Lebanon\t1\r\n North Macedonia\t1\r\n Morocco\t1\r\n Myanmar\t1\r\n Nigeria\t1\r\n Palestine\t1\r\n Peru\t1\r\n Philippines\t1\r\n Slovenia\t1\r\n Korea, South\t1\r\n Tanzania\t1\r\n Tibet\t1\r\n Trinidad and Tobago\t1\r\n Tunisia\t1\r\n Venezuela\t1\r\n Vietnam\t1\r\n Yemen\t1\r\nNotes\r\n John Bardeen awarded twice in physics;\r\nLinus C.

Credit: Peter Menzel/Science Source\r\nOne of the more unsettling discoveries in the past half century is that the universe is not locally real. “Real,” meaning that objects have definite properties independent of observation—an apple can be red even when no one is looking; “local” means objects can only be influenced by their surroundings, and that any influence cannot travel faster than light. Investigations at the frontiers of quantum physics have found that these things cannot both be true. Instead, the evidence shows objects are not influenced solely by their surroundings and they may also lack definite properties prior to measurement. As Albert Einstein famously bemoaned to a friend, “Do you really believe the moon is not there when you are not looking at it?”\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, deeply contrary to our everyday experiences. To paraphrase Douglas Adams, the demise of local realism has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.\r\n\r\nBlame for this achievement has now been laid squarely on the shoulders of three physicists: John Clauser, Alain Aspect and Anton Zeilinger. They equally split the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics “for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science.” (“Bell inequalities” refers to the pioneering work of the Northern Irish physicist John Stewart Bell, who laid the foundations for this year’s Physics Nobel in the early 1960s.) Colleagues agreed that the trio had it coming, deserving this reckoning for overthrowing reality as we know it. “It is fantastic news. It was long overdue,” says Sandu Popescu, a quantum physicist at the University of Bristol. “Without any doubt, the prize is well-deserved.”\r\n\r\n“The experiments beginning with the earliest one of Clauser and continuing along, show that this stuff isn’t just philosophical, it’s real—and like other real things, potentially useful,” says Charles Bennett, an eminent quantum researcher at IBM. \r\n\r\n“Each year I thought, ‘oh, maybe this is the year,’” says David Kaiser, a physicist and historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “This year, it really was. It was very emotional—and very thrilling.”\r\n\r\nQuantum foundations’ journey from fringe to favor was a long one. From about 1940 until as late as 1990, the topic was often treated as philosophy at best and crackpottery at worst. Many scientific journals refused to publish papers in quantum foundations, and academic positions indulging such investigations were nearly impossible to come by. In 1985, Popescu’s advisor warned him against a Ph.D. in the subject. “He said ‘look, if you do that, you will have fun for five years, and then you will be jobless,’” Popescu says.\r\n\r\nToday, quantum information science is among the most vibrant and impactful subfields in all of physics. It links Einstein’s general theory of relativity with quantum mechanics via the still-mysterious behavior of black holes. It dictates the design and function of quantum sensors, which are increasingly being used to study everything from earthquakes to dark matter. And it clarifies the often-confusing nature of quantum entanglement, a phenomenon that is pivotal to modern materials science and that lies at the heart of quantum computing.\r\n\r\n“What even makes a quantum computer ‘quantum’?” Nicole Yunger Halpern, a National Institute of Standards and Technology physicist, asks rhetorically. “One of the most popular answers is entanglement, and the main reason why we understand entanglement is the grand work participated in by Bell and these Nobel Prize–winners. Without that understanding of entanglement, we probably wouldn’t be able to realize quantum computers.”\r\n\r\nFOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS\r\nThe trouble with quantum mechanics was never that it made the wrong predictions—in fact, the theory described the microscopic world splendidly well right from the start when physicists devised it in the opening decades of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nWhat Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen took issue with, laid out in their iconic 1935 paper, was the theory’s uncomfortable implications for reality. Their analysis, known by their initials EPR, centered on a thought experiment meant to illustrate the absurdity of quantum mechanics; to show how under certain conditions the theory can break—or at least deliver nonsensical results that conflict with everything else we know about reality. A simplified and modernized version of EPR goes something like this: Pairs of particles are sent off in different directions from a common source, targeted for two observers, Alice and Bob, each stationed at opposite ends of the solar system. Quantum mechanics dictates that it is impossible to know the spin, a quantum property of individual particles prior to measurement. When Alice measures one of her particles, she finds its spin to be either up or down. Her results are random, and yet, when she measures up, she instantly knows Bob’s corresponding particle must be down. At first glance, this is not so odd; perhaps the particles are like a pair of socks—if Alice gets the right sock, Bob must have the left.\r\n\r\nBut under quantum mechanics, particles are not like socks, and only when measured do they settle on a spin of up or down. This is EPR’s key conundrum: If Alice’s particles lack a spin until measurement, how then when they whiz past Neptune do they know what Bob’s particles will do as they fly out of the solar system in the other direction? Each time Alice measures, she effectively quizzes her particle on what Bob will get if he flips a coin: up, or down? The odds of correctly predicting this even 200 times in a row are one in 1060—a number greater than all the atoms in the solar system. Yet despite the billions of kilometers that separate the particle pairs, quantum mechanics says Alice’s particles can keep correctly predicting, as though they were telepathically connected to Bob’s particles.\r\n\r\nnewsletter promo\r\nSign up for Scientific American’s free newsletters.\r\n\r\nSign Up\r\nAlthough intended to reveal the imperfections of quantum mechanics, when real-world versions of the EPR thought experiment are conducted the results instead reinforce the theory’s most mind-boggling tenets. Under quantum mechanics, nature is not locally real—particles lack properties such as spin up or spin down prior to measurement, and seemingly talk to one another no matter the distance.\r\n\r\nPhysicists skeptical of quantum mechanics proposed that there were “hidden variables,” factors that existed in some imperceptible level of reality beneath the subatomic realm that contained information about a particle’s future state. They hoped in hidden-variable theories, nature could recover the local realism denied to it by quantum mechanics.\r\n\r\n“One would have thought that the arguments of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen would produce a revolution at that moment, and everybody would have started working on hidden variables,” Popescu says.\r\n\r\nEinstein’s “attack” on quantum mechanics, however, did not catch on among physicists, who by and large accepted quantum mechanics as is. This was often less a thoughtful embrace of nonlocal reality, and more a desire to not think too hard while doing physics—a head-in-the-sand sentiment later summarized by the physicist David Mermin as a demand to “shut up and calculate.”\r\n\r\nThe lack of interest was driven in part because John von Neumann, a highly regarded scientist, had in 1932 published a mathematical proof ruling out hidden-variable theories. (Von Neumann’s proof, it must be said, was refuted just three years later by a young female mathematician, Grete Hermann, but at the time no one seemed to notice.)\r\n\r\nQuantum mechanics’ problem of nonlocal realism would languish in a complacent stupor for another three decades until being decisively shattered by Bell. From the start of his career, Bell was bothered by the quantum orthodoxy and sympathetic toward hidden variable theories. Inspiration struck him in 1952, when he learned of a viable nonlocal hidden-variable interpretation of quantum mechanics devised by fellow physicist David Bohm—something von Neumann had claimed was impossible. Bell mulled the ideas over for years, as a side project to his main job working as a particle physicist at CERN.\r\n\r\nIn 1964, Bell rediscovered the same flaws in von Neumann’s argument that Hermann had. And then, in a triumph of rigorous thinking, Bell concocted a theorem that dragged the question of hidden variables from its metaphysical quagmire onto the concrete ground of experiment.\r\n\r\nNormally, hidden-variable theories and quantum mechanics predict indistinguishable experimental outcomes. What Bell realized is that under precise circumstances, an empirical discrepancy between the two can emerge. In the eponymous Bell test (an evolution of the EPR thought experiment), Alice and Bob receive the same paired particles, but now they each have two different detector settings—A and a, B and b. These detector settings allow Alice and Bob to ask the particles different questions; an additional trick to throw off their apparent telepathy. In local hidden-variable theories, where their state is preordained and nothing links them, particles cannot outsmart this extra step, and they cannot always achieve the perfect correlation where Alice measures spin down when Bob measures spin up (and vice versa). But in quantum mechanics, particles remain connected and far more correlated than they could ever be in local hidden-variable theories. They are, in a word, entangled.\r\n\r\nMeasuring the correlation multiple times for many particle pairs, therefore, could prove which theory was correct. If the correlation remained below a limit derived from Bell’s theorem, this would suggest hidden variables were real; if it exceeded Bell’s limit, then the mind-boggling tenets of quantum mechanics would reign supreme. And yet, in spite of its potential to help determine the very nature of reality, after being published in a relatively obscure journal Bell’s theorem languished unnoticed for years.\r\n\r\nTHE BELL TOLLS FOR THEE\r\nIn 1967, John Clauser, then a graduate student at Columbia University, accidentally stumbled across a library copy of Bell’s paper and became enthralled by the possibility of proving hidden-variable theories correct. Clauser wrote to Bell two years later, asking if anyone had actually performed the test. Clauser’s letter was among the first feedback Bell had received.\r\n\r\nWith Bell’s encouragement, five years later Clauser and his graduate student Stuart Freedman performed the first Bell test. Clauser had secured permission from his supervisors, but little in the way of funds, so he became, as he said in a later interview, adept at “dumpster diving” to secure equipment—some of which he and Freedman then duct-taped together. In Clauser’s setup—a kayak-sized apparatus requiring careful tuning by hand—pairs of photons were sent in opposite directions toward detectors that could measure their state, or polarization.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Clauser and his infatuation with hidden variables, once he and Freedman completed their analysis, they could not help but conclude that they had found strong evidence against them. Still, the result was hardly conclusive, because of various “loopholes” in the experiment that conceivably could allow the influence of hidden variables to slip through undetected. The most concerning of these was the locality loophole: if either the photon source or the detectors could have somehow shared information (a plausible feat within the confines of a kayak-sized object), the resulting measured correlations could still emerge from hidden variables. As Kaiser puts it pithily, if Alice tweets at Bob which detector setting she’s in, that interference makes ruling out hidden variables impossible.\r\n\r\nClosing the locality loophole is easier said than done. The detector setting must be quickly changed while photons are on the fly—“quickly” meaning in a matter of mere nanoseconds. In 1976, a young French expert in optics, Alain Aspect, proposed a way for doing this ultra-speedy switch. His group’s experimental results, published in 1982, only bolstered Clauser’s results: local hidden variables looked extremely unlikely. “Perhaps Nature is not so queer as quantum mechanics,” Bell wrote in response to Aspect’s initial results. “But the experimental situation is not very encouraging from this point of view.”\r\n\r\nOther loopholes, however, still remained—and, alas, Bell died in 1990 without witnessing their closure. Even Aspect’s experiment had not fully ruled out local effects because it took place over too small a distance. Similarly, as Clauser and others had realized, if Alice and Bob were not ensured to detect an unbiased representative sample of particles, they could reach the wrong conclusions.\r\n\r\nNo one pounced to close these loopholes with more gusto than Anton Zeilinger, an ambitious, gregarious Austrian physicist. In 1998, he and his team improved on Aspect’s earlier work by conducting a Bell test over a then-unprecedented distance of nearly half a kilometer. The era of divining reality’s nonlocality from kayak-sized experiments had drawn to a close. Finally, in 2013, Zeilinger’s group took the next logical step, tackling multiple loopholes at the same time.\r\n\r\n“Before quantum mechanics, I actually was interested in engineering. I like building things with my hands,” says Marissa Giustina, a quantum researcher at Google who worked with Zeilinger.  “In retrospect, a loophole-free Bell experiment is a giant systems-engineering project.” One requirement for creating an experiment closing multiple loopholes was finding a perfectly straight, unoccupied 60-meter tunnel with access to fiber optic cables. As it turned out, the dungeon of Vienna’s Hofburg palace was an almost ideal setting—aside from being caked with a century’s worth of dust. Their results, published in 2015, coincided with similar tests from two other groups that also found quantum mechanics as flawless as ever.\r\n\r\nBELL’S TEST REACHES THE STARS\r\nOne great final loophole remained to be closed, or at least narrowed. Any prior physical connection between components, no matter how distant in the past, has the possibility of interfering with the validity of a Bell test’s results. If Alice shakes Bob’s hand prior to departing on a spaceship, they share a past. It is seemingly implausible that a local hidden-variable theory would exploit these loopholes, but still possible.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, a team including Kaiser and Zeilinger performed a cosmic Bell test. Using telescopes in the Canary Islands, the team sourced its random decisions for detector settings from stars sufficiently far apart in the sky that light from one would not reach the other for hundreds of years, ensuring a centuries-spanning gap in their shared cosmic past. Yet even then, quantum mechanics again proved triumphant.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal difficulties in explaining the importance of Bell tests to the public—as well as to skeptical physicists—is the perception that the veracity of quantum mechanics was a foregone conclusion. After all, researchers have measured many key aspects of quantum mechanics to a precision of greater than 10 parts in a billion. “I actually didn’t want to work on it. I thought, like, ‘Come on; this is old physics. We all know what’s going to happen,’” Giustina says. But the accuracy of quantum mechanics could not rule out the possibility of local hidden variables; only Bell tests could do that.\r\n\r\n“What drew each of these Nobel recipients to the topic, and what drew John Bell himself, to the topic was indeed [the question], ‘Can the world work that way?’” Kaiser says. “And how do we really know with confidence?” What Bell tests allow physicists to do is remove the bias of anthropocentric aesthetic judgments from the equation; purging from their work the parts of human cognition that recoil at the possibility of eerily inexplicable entanglement, or that scoff at hidden-variable theories as just more debates over how many angels may dance on the head of a pin. The award honors Clauser, Aspect and Zeilinger, but it is testament to all the researchers who were unsatisfied with superficial explanations about quantum mechanics, and who asked their questions even when doing so was unpopular.\r\n\r\n“Bell tests,” Giustina concludes, “are a very useful way of looking at reality.”\r\n\r\n",    "date":"6-10-2022",    "url":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-universe-is-not-locally-real-and-the-physics-nobel-prize-winners-proved-it/"}

{    "id":11,    "title":"Our Nobel Prize winners",    "text":"    The University of Manchester has a rich academic history. We can lay claim to 25 Nobel laureates among our current and former staff and students.\r\n\r\nJoseph John Thomson\r\n1906 Nobel Prize in Physics\r\nJJ Thomson studied electrical discharges in gases. Following the discovery of x-rays and radioactivity his imaginative work inspired many young researchers, including Ernest Rutherford, WL Bragg and CTR Wilson. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906, partly for showing that cathode rays in electrified gases were composed of ‘negative corpuscles’, soon to be known as electrons.\r\n\r\nThomson was the son of an antiquarian book dealer in Cheetham Hill, Manchester. Aged 14 he entered Owens College, now The University of Manchester, expecting to become an engineering apprentice. He studied with Osborne Reynolds, took some of the first courses in experimental physics and continued to Cambridge where, from the age of 28, he directed the Cavendish Laboratory.\r\n\r\nErnest Rutherford\r\n1908 Nobel Prize in Chemistry\r\nErnest Rutherford came from New Zealand to study with JJ Thomson in Cambridge. He then worked with the chemist Frederick Soddy at McGill University, showing that radioactive substances decay at constant rates, emitting characteristic radiations: alpha and beta particles and gamma rays. He received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1908 while he was Langworthy Professor of Physics at Manchester.\r\n\r\nIn the laboratory built at the University by Arthur Schuster, Rutherford created a world centre for experiments in atomic physics. Highlights included an experiment in 1909 by Ernest Marsden (still an undergraduate) and Hans Geiger, which suggested that atoms have dense nuclei; the nuclear model of atomic structure (1913); and the first artificial transmutation of an atomic nucleus (1917).\r\n\r\nWilliam Lawrence Bragg\r\n1915 Nobel Prize in Physics\r\nWhile still a research student, Lawrence Bragg discovered the law by which the positions of the atoms in crystals could be calculated from the way an x-ray beam is diffracted. In 1915, aged 25, he was the youngest ever winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics – jointly with his father, William Henry Bragg, then professor at Leeds.\r\n\r\nEducated in Adelaide and Cambridge, Bragg served in World War I. He then succeeded Rutherford as Langworthy Professor of Physics at Manchester, where he remained until 1937, building an important research programme in crystallography. When Bragg was back in Cambridge from the 1940s, this subject proved crucial for the structural analysis of DNA and proteins.\r\n\r\nNiels Bohr\r\n1922 Nobel Prize in Physics\r\nNiels Bohr won the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physics for investigating the structure of atoms and the radiation emanating from them. He argued that electrons move in defined orbits around an atom's nucleus, and that an element’s chemical properties depend on the higher-energy electrons in its atoms’ outer orbits. He remained a leader in theoretical physics from his research institute in Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nBohr’s father was an eminent physiologist at the University of Copenhagen, where Bohr studied philosophy and mathematics before transferring to physics. As a young theoretician he arrived at Manchester in 1912 to work with Ernest Rutherford, to whom he became devoted. In 1913 they mathematically systematised Rutherford’s nuclear model of the atom.\r\n\r\nArchibald Vivian Hill\r\n1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\r\nAV Hill shared the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Otto Myerhof. Hill’s physical studies of heat production and muscle mechanics had correlated revealingly with Myerhof’s biochemical research. From 1923 Hill worked at University College London, leading the development of biophysics. He was active in the politics of science, and especially important in resettling Jewish scientists from Nazi Germany.\r\n\r\nAfter training and research in physiology at Cambridge, Hill worked on ballistics during World War I. In 1920 he was appointed at Manchester as Brackenbury Professor of Physiology. He rapidly renovated the department and developed his sophisticated measurements of heat production during and after muscle contraction. One of the University’s life sciences buildings was named for him in 2008.\r\n\r\nCTR Wilson\r\n1927 Nobel Prize in Physics\r\nCTR Wilson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for making the pathways of charged particles visible. The creation of a cloud chamber was at the heart of his discovery; fellow Nobel laureate Ernest Rutherford called the particle detector “the most original and wonderful instrument in scientific history.”\r\n\r\nWilson was born on 14 February 1869 in Glencorse, Scotland and moved to Manchester shortly afterwards. He was educated at Owen’s College (now The University of Manchester) and went on to win a scholarship to study Physics at Cambridge University from 1888 to 1892.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 Wilson visited the summit of Ben Nevis – the highest mountain in the British Isles – and witnessed coronas and “glories” (coloured rings surrounding shadows cast on mist and cloud). On his return to the university’s Cavendish Laboratory, he was determined to build a device that could imitate these natural phenomena.\r\n\r\nMore than two decades later – aided by the pioneering discoveries of x-rays (1895) and natural radioactivity (1896) – the cloud chamber was perfected and Wilson published two papers on the tracks of electrons (1923).\r\n\r\nArthur Harden\r\n1929 Nobel Prize in Chemistry\r\nArthur Harden shared the 1929 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his studies of sugar fermentation by filtered yeast extracts. His many years of biochemical research at the British Institute of Preventative Medicine, later named the Lister Institute, established the various stages in the conversion of sugars to alcohol, the enzymes involved and the importance of phosphorus compounds in these processes.\r\n\r\nBorn in Manchester, Harden studied chemistry with Henry Roscoe at Owens College, the forerunner of The University of Manchester. He worked here as a lecturer for nine years, studying the chemical actions of light and the historical manuscripts of John Dalton. In London, from 1897, he worked as one of Britain’s first full-time researchers.\r\n\r\nJames Chadwick\r\n1935 Nobel Prize in Physics\r\nJames Chadwick was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935 for discovering a previously unknown particle in the nucleus of atoms: the neutron. Having no electrical charge, neutrons can penetrate and split the nuclei of even the heaviest elements. Though intensely shy, Chadwick was deeply involved in atomic politics during and after World War II.\r\n\r\nBorn in Bollington and schooled in Manchester, Chadwick studied physics at Manchester and worked here with Ernest Rutherford. In 1914, when researching in Hans Geiger’s Berlin laboratory, he was interned as an alien until 1918. He followed Rutherford from Manchester to Cambridge and became the assistant director of the Cavendish Laboratory. In 1935 he moved to the University of Liverpool, where he renovated the physics department and built a cyclotron.\r\n\r\nWalter Norman Haworth\r\n1937 Nobel Prize in Chemistry\r\nFrom 1925 Norman Haworth created a major school of carbohydrate chemistry at the University of Birmingham. He identified the chemical structures of many sugars and polysaccharides, and his pioneering synthesis of vitamin C opened the way to its large scale production. His research won him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1937, alongside the Swiss chemist Paul Karrer.\r\n\r\nAs a boy, Haworth worked at the John Rylands linoleum factory in Chorley, where experience of dyes aroused his interest in chemistry. He studied at Manchester, where he began research on synthetic chemistry under WH Perkin Jr. After further work in Göttingen he returned to Manchester as a research fellow, before taking a series of posts elsewhere.\r\n\r\nGeorge de Hevesy\r\n1943 Nobel Prize in Chemistry\r\nGeorge de Hevesy invented the use of radioactive isotopes as ‘tracers’ – a way of following the movements or transformations of an otherwise identical substance with which a tracer mixes. From the 1930s de Hevesy greatly extended this method using new, artificially produced, isotopes. He was awarded the 1943 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for pioneering the use of isotopes in the study of chemical processes.\r\n\r\nDe Hevesy studied chemistry and physics in his native Budapest, and then in Berlin, Freiburg, Zurich and Karlsruhe. From 1911 to 1913 he worked with Ernest Rutherford at Manchester, where he learned practical radiochemistry, became a lifelong friend of Niels Bohr and realised, over a cup of tea, that isotopes might be used as tracers – for example, to follow the course of ingested water.\r\n\r\nRobert Robinson\r\n1947 Nobel Prize in Chemistry\r\nRobert Robinson received the 1947 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his investigations on plant products of biological importance, especially the alkaloids. He used classical analytical methods, breaking down complex biological molecules into identifiable components and resynthesising them to establish the structure. The molecules he worked on included those in strychnine, steroids, plant pigments and other dyestuffs, penicillin, and anti-malarial drugs.\r\n\r\nRobinson, the son of a Chesterfield textile manufacturer, studied chemistry at Manchester with WH Perkin Jr. His career included professorial posts at Sydney, Liverpool, St Andrews and University College London, as well as military and industrial research. From 1922 to 1928 he was Professor of Organic Chemistry here before moving to Oxford in 1930, where Perkin had established a second leading department.\r\n\r\nPatrick Maynard Stuart Blackett\r\n1948 Nobel Prize in Physics\r\nPatrick Blackett photographed the tracks of atomic nucleus disintegration using CTR Wilson’s cloud chamber, which he automated so that cosmic rays could take their own photographs. He confirmed the existence of positrons (positive electrons), and that gamma rays can transform into electrons and positrons (pair production). In 1948 he received the Nobel Prize in Physics while working at Manchester.\r\n\r\nBlackett trained for the navy and served in World War I before studying physics with Ernest Rutherford at Cambridge. He was Langworthy Professor of Physics here from 1937 to 1953. His investigations into cosmic rays helped lead to Bernard Lovell’s work at Jodrell Bank, and his later research on geomagnetism was important for the plate tectonic revolution in geology. He was a leading advocate of ‘planned science’.\r\n\r\nJohn Douglas Cockcroft\r\n1951 Nobel Prize in Physics\r\nJohn Cockcroft shared the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics with Ernest Walton. At Cambridge they had created the first proton accelerator and used it to bombard lithium atoms. The resulting production of helium atoms was the first artificial nuclear transformation and a potential source of many new isotopes. From 1943 he helped lead Britain’s atomic programme, initially in Canada and then at Harwell.\r\n\r\nCockcroft, the son of a mill owner in Todmorden, studied mathematics at The University of Manchester and served in World War I. He then studied electrical engineering at Manchester College of Technology before becoming a college apprentice at the local Metropolitan-Vickers engineering company. After his work in Ernest Rutherford’s laboratory at Cambridge he helped organise radar defence during World War II.\r\n\r\nAlexander Todd\r\n1957 Nobel Prize in Chemistry\r\nAlexander Todd analysed biologically important molecules, including plant pigments and several vitamins. He showed that nucleotides, such as adenine, were constituents of DNA, and were related to key metabolic agents such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This work on ‘chemically interesting molecules’ proved crucial for Watson and Crick’s 1953 model of DNA, and won Todd the 1957 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\r\n\r\nFrom humble beginnings, Todd became a statesman of science. He read chemistry at Glasgow and investigated biological molecules at Frankfurt, before becoming a protégé of Robert Robinson at Oxford. As Professor of Organic Chemistry at Manchester from 1938 he worked on chemical weapons and began the studies of nucleotides, which he continued in Cambridge after 1944.\r\n\r\nMelvin Calvin\r\n1961 Nobel Prize in Chemistry\r\nMelvin Calvin used radioisotopes to study the complex pathways by which green plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates. His main tool, the isotope carbon 14, had been discovered at the University of California, Berkeley, where staff were keen to explore the peacetime uses of atomic science. His elucidation of the mechanisms of photosynthesis won him the 1961 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\r\n\r\nCalvin, the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, grew up and studied chemistry in Detroit, undertaking a PhD at the University of Minnesota. From 1935 to 1937 he worked with Michael Polanyi at Manchester and became interested in photochemistry, the subject of his life’s work. Contacts here led him to Berkeley, where he had an outstanding career.\r\n\r\nHans Albrecht Bethe\r\n1967 Nobel Prize in Physics\r\nHans Bethe worked at Cornell University for 70 years from 1935. His research topics included shifts in the energy levels of hydrogen atoms and the ‘many- body problem’ of atomic nuclei. His work on the nuclear reactions in stars won him the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physics. Like several notable scientists who worked on the atomic bomb, he advocated nuclear disarmament.\r\n\r\nBethe studied and researched in Germany until the Nazis came to power. As a result of the persecution of the Jews he emigrated in 1933 and took a temporary post at Manchester. His brief stay proved very productive, working in Lawrence Bragg’s laboratory with Rudolf Peierls, a friend from Munich. Prompted by James Chadwick, they created a theory of the deuteron during a train journey from Cambridge to Manchester.\r\n\r\nJohn Richard Hicks\r\n1972 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences\r\nJohn Hicks shared the 1972 Prize in Economic Sciences with Kenneth J Arrow for general equilibrium theory and welfare economics. Hicks created widely used conceptual tools for the analysis of price mechanisms, technical change, and demand for money. He was suspicious of theory for theory’s sake, the American idealisation of free markets and reliance on econometrics for contact with reality.\r\n\r\nHicks taught at the London School of Economics from 1926 after trying journalism at the Manchester Guardian. His pioneering work on general equilibrium theory was published while he was Professor of Political Economy at Manchester (from 1938 to 1946), after which he worked at Oxford. A close friend of the Manchester economic historian TS Ashton, he published A Theory of Economic History in 1969.\r\n\r\nNevill Francis Mott\r\n1977 Nobel Prize in Physics\r\nNevill Mott worked on nuclear and collision theory, investigated the properties of metals and semiconductors, and developed a theory of transition metals. At the age of 60 he began the work for which he shared the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physics with Philip Anderson and John H van Vleck: fundamental theoretical investigations of the electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems.\r\n\r\nMott’s parents both trained under JJ Thomson at Cambridge. Following undergraduate and postgraduate study there Mott worked with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen, confirming his vocation for theoretical physics. From 1929 to 1930 he was a lecturer at Manchester, where he wrote a book on wave mechanics. Through his association here with Lawrence Bragg, he gained a productive interest in the structure of materials.\r\n\r\nArthur Lewis\r\n1979 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences\r\nArthur Lewis received the 1979 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, becoming the first black winner in a category other than Peace. He placed ‘development’ in historical context, stressing the transfer of labour from the traditional agricultural sector to the more productive industrial sector. In his view development was not an exercise in applied neo-classical economics – political, social and cultural influences were vital.\r\n\r\nLewis, from Saint Lucia, studied and taught at the London School of Economics. He made his major contributions to development economics while professor at Manchester from 1948, teaching many Asian and African students. He advised the Colonial Office and, briefly, the newly independent Ghana. From 1958 to 1963 he led the University College of the West Indies, later working at Princeton.\r\n\r\nJohn Charles Polanyi\r\n1986 Nobel Prize in Chemistry\r\nJohn Charles Polanyi studied the mechanics of chemical reactions. His particular contribution involved measuring weak infrared emissions from the excited atoms of newly formed molecules, for which he received the 1986 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Dudley Herschbach and Yuan Lee. He was a proponent of nuclear disarmament and of ‘pure science’.\r\n\r\nJohn Polanyi was born in Berlin, moving to Manchester in 1933 when his Hungarian-Jewish father, Michael, became Professor of Physical Chemistry at this university. Evacuated to Canada during World War II, he returned and studied chemistry in Manchester, where his PhD was supervised by a student of his father. After postdoctoral work at Ottawa and Princeton, he made his career at the University of Toronto.\r\n\r\nMichael Smith\r\n1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry\r\nMichael Smith shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for work on site-directed mutagenesis. In the 1970s he discovered that single strands of synthetic DNA could bind to virus DNA, even if one base was incorrect – which provided a way of engineering DNA and thus proteins. In a range of private and public research centres, he explored potential medical and commercial applications.\r\n\r\nSmith came from Blackpool and won a scholarship to study chemistry at Manchester. After a PhD here in 1956 he took a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, to which he was attached for most of his career. In 2004 Manchester’s new biological sciences building was named in his honour.\r\n\r\nJoseph E Stiglitz\r\n2001 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences\r\nJoseph Stiglitz helped create ‘the economics of information’. He received the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for investigating monetary transactions where one party knows more than the other. He also explored market dysfunctions, the need for state intervention and problems of implementing economic reform. He advocated action against climate change and, later, reform of the international financial system.\r\n\r\nStiglitz received his PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and taught at several leading American universities. He chaired the US Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton and was chief economist at the World Bank in the 1990s, before becoming a major critic of neoliberal globalisation. In 2005 he was appointed chair of the Brooks World Poverty Institute at The University of Manchester.\r\n\r\nJohn Sulston\r\n2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\r\nJohn Sulston shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Sydney Brenner and H Robert Horvitz for research on the genetic regulation of tissue and organ development, including programmed cell death. By painstaking microscopical observations he had worked out the cell lineages in the developing nematode worm. He then led the analysis of the worm’s genome, before turning to human genomics.\r\n\r\nSulston studied nucleotide chemistry in Cambridge, and returned to Cambridge after postdoctoral work in California. Following his study of nematodes at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, he headed the British side of the Human Genome Project. His advocacy of open access to scientific information led to his appointment in 2007 as joint chair of The University of Manchester Institute for Science, Ethics and Innovation.\r\n\r\nAndre Geim\r\n2010 Nobel Prize in Physics\r\nAndre Geim shared the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics with Kostya Novoselov for preparing and then characterising individual atomic planes of carbon, known as graphene. In 2004 they demonstrated how to extract and isolate graphene from graphite crystals using Sellotape. Geim also shared the 2000 Ig Nobel Prize in Physics for his tongue-in-cheek diamagnetic levitation of a live frog.\r\n\r\nGeim studied and researched in Moscow, before taking postdoctoral positions in Britain and Denmark, where he investigated a variety of research topics. In 2001, after working in the Netherlands, he moved to a full professorship at Manchester, where he studied gecko tape and directed the Centre for Mesoscience and Nanotechnology. He was awarded the Langworthy Chair in 2007.\r\n\r\nKonstantin Novoselov\r\n2010 Nobel Prize in Physics\r\nKostya Novoselov and his Manchester colleague Andre Geim shared the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics for preparing graphene and discovering its remarkable properties. Its single layers of carbon atoms in hexagonal arrays give graphene great strength for its weight, and it conducts electrons faster than any other material at room temperature. Potential applications include electronics and new composite materials.\r\n\r\nRussian-born Novoselov studied in the Soviet Union before beginning a PhD in the Netherlands with Andre Geim. He moved to The University of Manchester to rejoin Geim, won Leverhulme and Royal Society research fellowships, and in 2010 became a professor of physics. Their 2010 award was said to show that you can still win a Nobel Prize for ‘mucking about in a lab’.\r\n\r\n    ",    "date":"27-10-2022",    "url":"https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/history-heritage/history/nobel-prize/"}

{"id":17,"title":"Nobel Laureates","text":"Nobel Prizes have been awarded to 97 scholars who were UChicago faculty members, students, or researchers at some point in their careers. Some of the Nobel winners whose work is closely associated with the University are Milton Friedman (Economics, 1976), Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (Physics, 1983), Saul Bellow (Literature, 1976), Charles Huggins (Physiology or Medicine, 1966), and Willard Libby (Chemistry, 1960). The University of Chicago’s first Nobel Laureate was Albert A. Michelson. The first American to win the Nobel Prize in any of the sciences, Michelson was recognized in 1907 for his measurements of the speed of light. Robert A.

Michael Armstrong Professor of Genetic Medicine, Pediatrics, Oncology, Medicine, Radiation Oncology and Biological Chemistry\r\nDirector of the Vascular Program at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Cell Engineering\r\n\r\nDr. Semenza was awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He shares the award with William G. Kaelin, Jr., M.D. of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Peter J. Ratcliffe of Oxford University. The Academy recognized him for his ground-breaking discovery in the laboratory of hypoxia inducible factor 1 or HIF-1, which helps cells cope with low oxygen levels. The discovery has far-reaching implications in understanding low oxygen health conditions such as coronary artery disease and tumor growth.\r\nDr. Semenza works on research in the lab.\r\nCarol Greider, Ph.D.\r\nUniversity Professor\r\nProfessor of Molecular Biology and Genetics\r\n\r\nDr. Greider, one of the world’s pioneering researchers on the structure of chromosome ends known as telomeres, was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Her improbable discovery of telomerase – a remarkable enzyme that restores telomeres and protects them from damage – catalyzed an explosion of scientific studies which, to this day, probe connections between telomerase and telomeres to human cancer and diseases of aging.\r\nDr. Greider working in the lab.\r\nNobel Prize in Chemistry\r\nPeter Agre, M.D.\r\nBloomberg Distinguished Professor\r\nDirector of the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute\r\n\r\nDr. Agre received the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovery of the aquaporin water channels. Referred to as the \"plumbing system of cells,\" aquaporins facilitate the movement of water across cell membranes [rapid osmosis]. Aquaporins are responsible for generation all biological fluids - cerebrospinal fluid, aqueous humor, tears, sweat, saliva, and concentration of urine. Aquaporins are also involved in plant biology and infectious diseases.\r\nPeter Agre in the lab.\r\n \r\nMore About Johns Hopkins Nobel Prize Winners\r\nOur Nobel winners include recipients of the prize in Medicine, Physics, Chemistry, Economics, Physiology, and two Nobel Peace Prize honorees.

{"id":21,"title":"History","text":"The Nobel Peace Prize and the other Nobel Prizes were established by the Swedish inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel through his last will.\r\n\r\nWhen the Swedish businessman Alfred Nobel passed away in 1896, he left behind what was then one of the world’s largest private fortunes. In his last will Nobel declared that the whole of his remaining fortune of 31, 5 million Swedish crowns was to be invested in safe securities and should constitute a fund \"the interest on which shall be annually distributed in the form of prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind\"\r\n\r\nWill\r\nThe will specified in which fields the prizes should be awarded – physics, chemistry, medicine or physiology, literature and peace – and which criteria the respective prize committees should apply when choosing their prize recipients. According to the will the Nobel Peace Prize was to be awarded “to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between the nations and the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the formation and spreading of peace congresses.”\r\n\r\nNorwegian Nobel Committee\r\nAlfred Nobel’s will declared that the Nobel Peace Prize was to be awarded by a committee of five persons selected by the Norwegian Storting (parliament). The Storting accepted the assignment in April 1897, and the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Storting was set up in August of the same year. Read more about the Norwegian Nobel Committee (as it is now known) here.\r\n\r\nNobel Foundation\r\nIn Sweden, however, Nobel's will triggered a lengthy legal battle with parts of the Nobel family. It was not until this conflict had been resolved, and financial matters had been satisfactorily arranged through the establishment of the Nobel Foundation in Sweden in 1900, that the Norwegian Nobel Committee and the other prize-awarding bodies could begin their work.\r\n\r\nFirst award\r\nThe first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901. The Peace Prize for that year was shared between the Frenchman Frédéric Passy and the Swiss Jean Henry Dunant.\r\n\r\nPainting of Alfred Nobel\r\nAlfred Nobel\r\nAlfred Nobel's family descended from Olof Rudbeck, the most famous scientist in Sweden in the 17th century. Alfred was fluent in several languages.\r\n\r\nShare certificate\r\nAlfred Nobel's fortune\r\nWhen the Swedish businessman and inventor Alfred Nobel passed away in 1896, he left behind what was then one of the world’s largest private fortunes.\r\n\r\nFirst paragraph of Alfred Nobel's will\r\nAlfred Nobel's will\r\nAlfred Nobel was very interested in cultural and peace-related issues, and the prizes he established reflect this: .\"...to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind.\"\r\n\r\nWhy Norway?\r\nNo one knows for sure why Alfred Nobel wanted the Peace Prize in particular to be awarded by a Norwegian committee - or what prompted him to include Norway in the Nobel Prize proceedings at all.\r\n\r\n","date":"4-10-2022","url":"https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/nobel-peace-prize/history/"}

{"id":22,"title":"The United Nations and the Nobel Peace Prize","text":"The will Alfred Nobel made in 1895 was inspired by belief in the community of man. The Peace Prize was to be awarded to the person who had done most for \"fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses\".\r\n\r\nIn 75 years, the United Nations, its specialised agencies, related agencies, funds, programmes and staff were awarded the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize twelve times. One agency, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) received the famous prize in both 1954 and 1981.\r\n\r\nTwo Secretaries-General, Kofi Annan and Dag Hammarskjöld, were also honoured for their work by the Norwegian Nobel Committee. After being awarded the prize jointly with the world body, Secretary-General Kofi Annan in 2001 told UN staff he hoped that winning the prize \"will urge us forward and encourage all of us to tackle our tasks with even greater determination\".\r\n\r\n\"For one hundred years, the Norwegian Nobel Committee has sought to strengthen organized cooperation between states. The end of the cold war has at last made it possible for the U.N. to perform more fully the part it was originally intended to play.

{"id":25,"title":"Path to the Nobel Prize","text":"The Path to the Nobel Prize\r\n[Arthur B. McDonald accepting the Nobel Prize]ce]\r\nThe Prize\r\nThe 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded jointly to Dr. Arthur B. McDonald and Dr. Takaaki Kajita “for the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which shows that neutrinos have mass.” This revolutionary work redefined the basic laws of particle physics, and confirmed the detailed understanding of how the sun burns.\r\n\r\nThe Nobel Prize was established in 1901. Dr. McDonald is the fourth Canadian, and first faculty member of Queen’s University, to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics. In December 2015, Dr. McDonald travelled to Sweden to receive the Nobel Prize medal from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe medal depicts Alfred Nobel (1833-1896), who bequeathed the bulk of his fortune to honour outstanding contributions to humanity.\r\n\r\nThe inscription on the reverse of the medal for physics, taken from Virgil’s Aeneid, reads, “Inventas vitam iuvat excoluisse per artes,” which, loosely translated, says, “And they who bettered life on earth by their newly found mastery.”\r\n\r\nSolving the Solar Neutrino Problem\r\nOutstanding scientific contributions to measurements of basic neutrino properties and solar models have moved us closer to understanding our universe and its evolution.\r\n\r\nPainstaking efforts by an international scientific collaboration, under Dr. McDonald’s leadership as Director of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) experiment, led to the creation of the ultimate low-radioactivity instrument. This instrument ultimately solved the Solar Neutrino Problem, which was a major discrepancy between the measurement of the number of neutrinos reaching the earth and the theoretical models of the number generated in the solar interior. The original Directors of the SNO scientific collaboration in 1964 were Queen’s Dr. George Ewan and Dr. Herb Chen of the University of California, Irvine, and many members of the physics and other departments at Queen’s and other institutions provided expertise throughout the project.\r\n\r\nThe SNO experiment was carried out in a unique low-radioactivity laboratory near Sudbury, Ontario, two kilometres underground, to eliminate radioactivity from cosmic rays. SNO separately observed electron neutrinos from all active neutrino types, providing clear evidence that the electron neutrinos from the core of the sun were changing their type, a process arising from neutrinos of finite mass undergoing oscillations. The results from SNO, coupled with results for atmospheric neutrinos from the Super-Kamiokande experiment in Japan, required modifications to the Standard Model of Elementary Particles to include massive neutrinos. SNO results also provided a very accurate confirmation of current models of the sun and its energy-generation processes.\r\n\r\nAfter years of study by the scientific community, answering these questions was a major accomplishment, and provided increased insight into the evolution of our universe and neutrinos – fundamental building blocks of nature. To this day, results from SNO are motivating new experiments at SNOLAB, an expanded underground laboratory, as well as internationally. All of these experiments are aimed at further understanding neutrino properties and their effects in the early universe.\r\n\r\nFor his leadership and scientific scholarship, Dr. McDonald has received dozens of national and international honours, most notably the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics and the 2016 Breakthrough Prize. In 2018, the Arthur B. McDonald Canadian Astroparticle Physics Research Centre, based at Queen’s, was launched thanks to support from the Canada First Research Excellence Fund. These accolades brought worldwide attention to Canadian research excellence and its inspirational potential.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n[Dr. McDonald receiving Nobel Prize]\r\nA Nobel Prize in Physics for Dr. Arthur B.
